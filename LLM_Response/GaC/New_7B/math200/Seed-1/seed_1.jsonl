{"task_name": "math", "generation": "To find the remainder when the polynomial \\(x^{18} + x^{13} + x^7 + x^4 + x\\) is divided by \\(x^3 - x\\), we can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. However, since the divisor is a cubic polynomial, we can also use the fact that the remainder will be a polynomial of degree less than 3 (since the degree of the divisor is 3). Therefore, we can express the remainder as \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\nGiven that the divisor is \\(x^3 - x = x(x^2 - 1) = x(x-1)(x+1)\\), we can use the Remainder Theorem to find the remainder. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial \\(f(x)\\) by a linear polynomial \\(x - k\\) is \\(f(k)\\). For our case, we need to find the remainder when \\(x^{18} + x^{13} + x^7 + x^4 + x\\) is divided by \\(x^3 - x\\), which is equivalent to finding the value of the polynomial at \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 1\\), and \\(x = -1\\).\n\nLet's evaluate the polynomial at these points:\n\n1. When \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[f(0) = 0^{18} + 0^{13} + 0^7 + 0^4 + 0 = 0\\]\nSo, the remainder when evaluated at \\(x = 0\\) is 0.\n\n2.

When \\(x = -1\\):\n\\[f(-1) = (-1)^{18} + (-1)^{13} + (-1)^7 + (-1)^4 + (-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = -1\\]\nSo, the remainder when evaluated at \\(x = -1\\) is -1.\n\nSince the remainder is a polynomial of degree less than 3, we can write it as \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\).

{"task_name": "math", "generation": "To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of all possible alternating sums for the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Alternating Sum\n\nFor any subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$, the alternating sum is calculated by arranging the numbers in decreasing order and then alternately adding and subtracting them. For example, for the subset $\\{1, 2, 3, 6, 9\\}$, the alternating sum is $9 - 6 + 3 - 2 + 1 = 5$.\n\n### Step 2: Contribution of Each Element\n\nConsider an element $k$ in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. We want to find the contribution of $k$ to the total sum of all alternating sums.\n\n#### Case 1: $k$ is the largest element in the subset\n\nIf $k$ is the largest element in the subset, then it will always be added to the alternating sum. The contribution of $k$ in this case is simply $k$ times the number of subsets that contain $k$ as the largest element.\n\n#### Case 2: $k$ is not the largest element in the subset\n\nIf $k$ is not the largest element in the subset, then it can either be added or subtracted depending on its position in the subset. The contribution of $k$ in this case is $k$ times the number of subsets that contain $k$ but not as the largest element.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Subsets\n\nFor each element $k$, we need to count the number of subsets that contain $k$ as the largest element and the number of subsets that contain $k$ but not as the largest element.\n\n- **Subsets containing $k$ as the largest element**: There are $2^{n-1}$ subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ that contain $k$ as the largest element. This is because we can choose any combination of the remaining $n-1$ elements to be included in the subset.\n- **Subsets containing $k$ but not as the largest element**: There are $2^{n-1} - 1$ subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ that contain $k$ but not as the largest element. This is because we exclude the subset that contains only $k$ itself.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Total Contribution\n\nThe total contribution of $k$ to the sum of all alternating sums is the sum of its contributions in both cases:\n\n\\[k \\times 2^{n-1} + k \\times (2^{n-1} - 1) = k \\times (2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - 1) = k \\times (2^n - 1)\\]\n\n### Step 5: Summing Up Contributions for All Elements\n\nWe need to sum up the contributions of all elements from $1$ to $7$:\n\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^{7} k \\times (2^7 - 1) = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) \\times (2^7 - 1)\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Expression\n\nFirst, calculate the sum of the first 7 natural numbers:\n\n\\[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = \\frac{7 \\times (7 + 1)}{2} = 28\\]\n\nThen, calculate the value of $2^7 - 1$:\n\n\\[2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127\\]\n\nFinally, multiply the two results:\n\n\\[28 \\times 127 = 3556\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe sum of all possible alternating sums for $n=7$ is $\\boxed{3556}$.", "idx": 94}
