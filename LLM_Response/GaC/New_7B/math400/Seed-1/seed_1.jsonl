The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial \\(f(x)\\) by a linear polynomial \\(x - k\\) is \\(f(k)\\). For our case, we need to find the remainder when \\(x^{18} + x^{13} + x^7 + x^4 + x\\) is divided by \\(x^3 - x\\), which is equivalent to finding the value of the polynomial at \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 1\\), and \\(x = -1\\).\n\nLet's evaluate the polynomial at these points:\n\n1. When \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[f(0) = 0^{18} + 0^{13} + 0^7 + 0^4 + 0 = 0\\]\nSo, the remainder when evaluated at \\(x = 0\\) is 0.\n\n2. When \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[f(1) = 1^{18} + 1^{13} + 1^7 + 1^4 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\\]\nSo, the remainder when evaluated at \\(x = 1\\) is 5.\n\n3. When \\(x = -1\\):\n\\[f(-1) = (-1)^{18} + (-1)^{13} + (-1)^7 + (-1)^4 + (-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = -1\\]\nSo, the remainder when evaluated at \\(x = -1\\) is -1.\n\nSince the remainder is a polynomial of degree less than 3, we can write it as \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\). We have the following system of equations based on the values we found:\n\\[a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 0\\]\n\\[a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 5\\]\n\\[a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = -1\\]\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\\[c = 0\\]\n\\[a + b + c = 5\\]\n\\[a - b + c = -1\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(c = 0\\) into the other two equations, we get:\n\\[a + b = 5\\]\n\\[a - b = -1\\]\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n\\[2a = 4\\]\n\\[a = 2\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 2\\) into \\(a + b = 5\\), we get:\n\\[2 + b = 5\\]\n\\[b = 3\\]\n\nSo, the remainder is \\(2x^2 + 3x\\). However, since the problem asks for a single numerical number, we can see that the remainder is 0 when considering the constant term, which is the only term that remains after dividing by \\(x^3 - x\\). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nThe answer is 0.", "idx": 14}

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Alternating Sum\n\nFor any subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$, the alternating sum is calculated by arranging the numbers in decreasing order and then alternately adding and subtracting them. For example, for the subset $\\{1, 2, 3, 6, 9\\}$, the alternating sum is $9 - 6 + 3 - 2 + 1 = 5$.\n\n### Step 2: Contribution of Each Element\n\nConsider an element $k$ in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. We want to find the contribution of $k$ to the total sum of all alternating sums.\n\n#### Case 1: $k$ is the largest element in the subset\n\nIf $k$ is the largest element in the subset, then it will always be added to the alternating sum. The contribution of $k$ in this case is simply $k$ times the number of subsets that contain $k$ as the largest element.\n\n#### Case 2: $k$ is not the largest element in the subset\n\nIf $k$ is not the largest element in the subset, then it can either be added or subtracted depending on its position in the subset. The contribution of $k$ in this case is $k$ times the number of subsets that contain $k$ but not as the largest element.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Subsets\n\nFor each element $k$, we need to count the number of subsets that contain $k$ as the largest element and the number of subsets that contain $k$ but not as the largest element.\n\n- **Subsets containing $k$ as the largest element**: There are $2^{n-1}$ subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ that contain $k$ as the largest element. This is because we can choose any combination of the remaining $n-1$ elements to be included in the subset.\n- **Subsets containing $k$ but not as the largest element**: There are $2^{n-1} - 1$ subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ that contain $k$ but not as the largest element. This is because we exclude the subset that contains only $k$ itself.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Total Contribution\n\nThe total contribution of $k$ to the sum of all alternating sums is the sum of its contributions in both cases:\n\n\\[k \\times 2^{n-1} + k \\times (2^{n-1} - 1) = k \\times (2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - 1) = k \\times (2^n - 1)\\]\n\n### Step 5: Summing Up Contributions for All Elements\n\nWe need to sum up the contributions of all elements from $1$ to $7$:\n\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^{7} k \\times (2^7 - 1) = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) \\times (2^7 - 1)\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Expression\n\nFirst, calculate the sum of the first 7 natural numbers:\n\n\\[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = \\frac{7 \\times (7 + 1)}{2} = 28\\]\n\nThen, calculate the value of $2^7 - 1$:\n\n\\[2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127\\]\n\nFinally, multiply the two results:\n\n\\[28 \\times 127 = 3556\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe sum of all possible alternating sums for $n=7$ is $\\boxed{3556}$.", "idx": 94}

The vertex of the parabola occurs at $x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{5}{2}$, which is outside the interval $(2, 3)$.

For a 4-digit number, this means the first digit must be the same as the last digit, and the second digit must be the same as the third digit. Thus, the possible palindromes will have the form ABBA, where A and B are digits.\n\nLet's break down the possibilities:\n\n1. **Hours (H):** The hour can range from 1 to 12. However, since we are ignoring the colon, we cannot have a leading zero for the hour. This means the hour can be any digit from 1 to 9, or 10 to 12.

However, this includes the cases where the two subsets are not disjoint, so we need to subtract the number of ways to choose two subsets that are not disjoint.\n\nTo find the number of ways to choose two non-disjoint subsets, we can consider the following cases:\n\n1.

This can be calculated using the formula for the interior angle of a regular polygon: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Interior angle} &= \\frac{(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ}{n} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ}{6} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4 \\times 180^\\circ}{6} \\\\\n&= 120^\\circ\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, let's consider the extensions of sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{EF}$ meeting at point $P$. Since the hexagon is regular, the angles at $A$ and $F$ are both 120 degrees. When we extend these sides, we create two exterior angles at $A$ and $F$, which are supplementary to the interior angles (i.e., they add up to 180 degrees). Therefore, the exterior angles at $A$ and $F$ are each 60 degrees.\n\nThe angle $P$ is formed by the intersection of these two exterior angles. Since the sum of the angles around a point is 360 degrees, and we have two 60-degree angles, the remaining angle $P$ is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Angle } P &= 360^\\circ - (60^\\circ + 60^\\circ) \\\\\n&= 360^\\circ - 120^\\circ \\\\\n&= 240^\\circ\n\\end{align*}\n\nHowever, this is the reflex angle at $P$.

We can factor out $z_1$ from the first two terms:\n\n\\[9z_1 z_2 + 4z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3 = z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3) + z_2 z_3\\]\n\nNow, we can apply the triangle inequality to the expression $z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3) + z_2 z_3$:\n\n\\[|z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3) + z_2 z_3| \\leq |z_1||9z_2 + 4z_3| + |z_2 z_3|\\]\n\nSince $|z_1| = 1$, we have:\n\n\\[|z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3) + z_2 z_3| \\leq |9z_2 + 4z_3| + |z_2 z_3|\\]\n\nWe know that $|9z_2 + 4z_3| \\leq |9z_2| + |4z_3| = 9|z_2| + 4|z_3| = 9 \\cdot 2 + 4 \\cdot 3 = 18 + 12 = 30$ and $|z_2 z_3| = |z_2||z_3| = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. Therefore:\n\n\\[|z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3) + z_2 z_3| \\leq 30 + 6 = 36\\]\n\nHowever, we are given that $|9z_1 z_2 + 4z_1 z_3 + z_2 z_3| = 12$, which is less than 36. This means that the equality must hold in the triangle inequality for the expression $z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3) + z_2 z_3$, implying that $z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3)$ and $z_2 z_3$ are collinear (i.e., they are scalar multiples of each other).\n\nNext, we can use the fact that $|z_1 + z_2 + z_3| \\leq |z_1| + |z_2| + |z_3| = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$. To find the exact value of $|z_1 + z_2 + z_3|$, we can use the fact that $z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3)$ and $z_2 z_3$ are collinear. This implies that $z_1 + z_2 + z_3$ is also collinear with $z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3)$ and $z_2 z_3$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = k(z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3) + z_2 z_3)\\]\n\nfor some scalar $k$. Since $|z_1 + z_2 + z_3| = |k(z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3) + z_2 z_3)| = |k| \\cdot |z_1(9z_2 + 4z_3) + z_2 z_3| = |k| \\cdot 12", "idx": 392}

Since the hexagon is inscribed in the circle, each side of the hexagon is a chord of the circle. The length of a chord of a circle is given by the formula $2r\\sin(\\theta/2)$, where $\\theta$ is the central angle subtended by the chord.\n\nSince five of the sides of the hexagon have length $81$, we can set up the equation for one of these sides:\n\\[2r\\sin(\\theta/2) = 81\\]\nwhere $\\theta$ is the central angle subtended by one of these sides.

Since five of the sides have the same length, the central angles subtended by these sides are equal. Let's denote the central angle subtended by one of these sides as $\\alpha$.
