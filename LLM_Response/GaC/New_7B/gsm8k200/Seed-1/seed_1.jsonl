Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \\(r\\). Then, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \\(3 \\times r \\times 6 = 18r\\).\n\n2. **Hamsters:** There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of hamsters in each cage as \\(h\\). Then, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \\(10 \\times h \\times 5 = 50h\\).\n\n3. **Rabbits:** There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among them. Let's denote the number of rabbits as \\(b\\). Then, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is \\(20\\).\n\n4. **Total Straw:** The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160. This is the sum of the straw given to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits: \\(18r + 50h + 20 = 160\\).\n\n5. **Solving for Rats:** We can simplify the equation to find the number of rats in each cage: \\(18r + 50h + 20 = 160\\). Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us \\(18r + 50h = 140\\). Since we know that the number of hamsters per cage is not specified, we can't directly solve for \\(r\\) without more information about \\(h\\). However, we can find the number of rats in each cage if we assume that the number of hamsters per cage is such that the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is equal to the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats.\n\nGiven that the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \\(18r\\), and the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \\(50h\\), we can set up the equation \\(18r = 50h\\). Solving for \\(r\\) gives us \\(r = \\frac{50h}{18}\\).\n\nSince we know that the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is part of the 160 pieces of straw, we can substitute \\(18r\\) with \\(160 - 50h - 20 = 140 - 50h\\). This gives us \\(140 - 50h = 18r\\). Substituting \\(r = \\frac{50h}{18}\\) into this equation gives us \\(140 - 50h = 18 \\times \\frac{50h}{18}\\), which simplifies to \\(140 - 50h = 50h\\). Solving for \\(h\\) gives us \\(h = 2\\).\n\nNow that we know \\(h = 2\\), we can find \\(r\\) by substituting \\(h\\) back into the equation \\(r = \\frac{50h}{18}\\): \\(r = \\frac{50 \\times 2}{18} = \\frac{100}{18} = \\frac{50}{9}\\). Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we can conclude that the number of rats in each cage is 5 (since \\(\\frac{50}{9}\\) is approximately 5.55, and we can't have a fraction of a rat).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: the number of rats in each cage is 5.", "idx": 130}
