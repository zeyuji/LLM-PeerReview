We can set up an equation to represent this: $2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $x$, we get $30x = 7 - 2 - 1.5 - 2 = 1.5$. Dividing both sides by 30, we find $x = \\frac{1.5}{30} = 0.05$.\nStep 8:  However, since we're dealing with episodes, we need to convert this to a whole number. Since 0.05 is equivalent to 3 minutes, which is less than 30 minutes, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Frankie watched $\\boxed{2}$ 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.\n\nThe final answer is: the answer is 2.  The final answer is 2.  The final answer is 2.  The final answer is 2.

When her arms are not raised, her tap rate is 300 taps per minute for her right foot and 250 taps per minute for her left foot.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of taps when her arms are raised:\n- In 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps each foot 200 times per minute, so in 2 minutes, she taps each foot 2 * 200 = 400 times.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of taps when her arms are not raised:\n- In the remaining 3 minutes (5 minutes - 2 minutes), her arms are not raised, so her tap rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute for both feet combined.\n- In 3 minutes, she taps both feet 3 * 550 = 1650 times.\n\nFinally, let's add the number of taps when her arms are raised to the number of taps when her arms are not raised:\n- The total number of taps is 400 (arms raised) + 1650 (arms not raised) = 2050 taps.\n\nThe answer is: the answer is 2050.</s>", "idx": 170, "selected_model": 1}

Since the tree costs $90 to plant, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net annual profit to cover this cost.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of years to break even\nTo calculate the number of years to break even, we divide the total cost of planting the tree by the net annual profit.

We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. Let's call the cost of the lot 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x = 120,000. Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us x = 30,000. This means that the lot cost $30,000. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches.

Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as B. We can set up the equation as follows: 9B + 10 = 100.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for B\nTo solve for B, we need to isolate B on one side of the equation.

Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as B. We can set up the equation as follows: 9B + 10 = 100.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for B\nTo solve for B, we need to isolate B on one side of the equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get 9B = 90.\n\n## Step 4: Divide both sides by 9 to find B\nNow, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to find the value of B. B = 90 / 9 = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: the answer is 10. ## Step 1: Convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches\nFirst, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Then, we add the 4 inches to get a total of 100 inches for the length of Topher's shoe.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information\nWe are told that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one", "idx": 257, "selected_model": 0}

To find out how many years ago Digimon came out, we need to determine the difference between John's current age and his age when Digimon came out. Let's denote this difference by \\( x \\). Therefore, John's age when Digimon came out was \\( 28 - x \\) and Jim's age was \\( 28 - x - y \\), where \\( y \\) is the number of years before Digimon came out.

The correct approach is to recognize that the difference in their ages remains constant over time. So, if John is currently 28 and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, the difference in their ages is:\n\n\\[ 28 - 2K = K \\]\n\\[ 28 = 3K \\]\n\\[ K = \\frac{28}{3} \\approx 9.33 \\]\n\nSince ages are typically whole numbers, we need to recheck the problem constraints.

Therefore, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\]\n\nThis gives us the equation:\n\\[ C + B = 10 \\]\n\nNow we substitute the expression for \\( B \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( C \\):\n\\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \\]\n\\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \\]\n\\[ 4C = 12 \\]\n\\[ C = 3 \\]\n\nSo, Carly made 3 cupcakes.
