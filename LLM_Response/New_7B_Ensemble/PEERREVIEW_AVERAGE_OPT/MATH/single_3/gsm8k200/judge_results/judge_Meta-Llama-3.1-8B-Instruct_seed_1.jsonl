To find 50% of the minimum payment, we need to multiply the minimum payment by 0.5. \nFor the student loans, the minimum payment is $300. 50% of $300 is $300 x 0.5 = $150.

{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " the answer is 100. \n\nThe first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so let's call the number of cases the second house needs x. Then the first house needs x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*(x/2) = x cases. The total number of cases is 250, so x + x/2 + x = 250. Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get 2x + x + 2x = 500. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 500. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 100. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*(x/2) = 2*50 = 100 cases. The answer is 100. \n\nI used the variable x to represent the number of cases the second house needs. I then used the information given in the problem to set up an equation. I solved the equation to find the value of x, and then used that value to find the number of cases the third house needs. This is an example of a system of linear equations, but it is not necessary to use that term to solve the problem. The key is to use the information given in the problem to set up an equation, and then solve the equation to find the answer. \n\nThis problem is an example of a word problem, which is a type of math problem that involves a real-world scenario. It requires the student to read and understand the problem, and then use math to solve it. This type of problem is often used to assess a student's ability to apply math to real-world situations. \n\nIn this problem, the student is required to use algebraic thinking to solve the problem. They must use variables to represent unknown values, and then use equations to solve for those values. This type of thinking is an important part of algebra, and is also used in many other areas of math. \n\nThe student is also required to use critical thinking skills to solve the problem. They must read and understand the problem, and then use math to solve it. This requires the student to think critically about the information given in the problem, and to use that information to make logical conclusions. \n\nOverall, this problem is a good example of a math problem that requires the student to use algebraic thinking and critical thinking skills to solve. It is a challenging problem, but it is also a good opportunity for the student to practice and develop these skills. \n\nI hope this helps!

{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " is 1\nTo solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of the bill, including the tip. The bill is $50, and the tip is 20% of that amount. To find 20% of $50, we multiply $50 by 0.20 (since 20% is the same as 0.20). This gives us $10. So the total amount of the bill, including the tip, is $50 + $10 = $60.

First, let's find out how many straw pieces are used for rats and hamsters.\n   - Rats: 3 cages * (number of rats per cage) * 6 straw pieces = 18 * (number of rats per cage)\n   - Hamsters: 10 cages * 5 straw pieces = 50 straw pieces\n\n2. The total straw pieces used for small rodents are 160, so we can write an equation:\n   18 * (number of rats per cage) + 50 = 160\n\n3. To solve for the number of rats per cage, we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:\n   18 * (number of rats per cage) = 160 - 50\n   18 * (number of rats per cage) = 110\n\n4. Now, divide both sides by 18 to find the number of rats per cage:\n   (number of rats per cage) = 110 / 18\n\n5. Simplify the fraction:\n   (number of rats per cage) = 11 / 2\n\nSo, the answer is: the answer is 11/2. This means that there are 11 rats in each cage, but since we cannot have a fraction of a rat, we can interpret this as having 6 full cages of 11 rats each, with 1 rat left over. However, since the question asks for a single numerical number, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 rats per cage.</s>", "idx": 130, "selected_model": 1}

{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " First, let's calculate how much Carlos earns from selling lemons each year:\n\nHe gets 7 lemons per year, and each lemon sells for $1.5. So, his earnings from selling lemons each year are:\n\\[7 \\text{ lemons/year} \\times \\$1.5/\\text{lemon} = \\$10.5/\\text{year}\\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree each year from his earnings to find out how much he makes net profit each year:\n\\[\\$10.5/\\text{year} - \\$3/\\text{year} = \\$7.5/\\text{year}\\]\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) at this net profit rate of $7.5 per year.\n\nTo do this, divide the initial cost by the annual net profit:\n\\[\\frac{\\$90}{\\$7.5/\\text{year}} = 12 \\text{ years}\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree. \n\nThe answer is {12}.<|im_end|>", "idx": 197, "selected_model": 2}
{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The total points scored by the four students is 251.\n2. Naomi scored 68 points.\n3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.\n4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many points Yuri scored:\n- Half of Naomi's points: \\( \\frac{68}{2} = 34 \\)\n- Yuri scored 10 more than this: \\( 34 + 10 = 44 \\)\n\nNext, we calculate how many points Brianna scored:\n- Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi: \\( 68 + 17 = 85 \\)\n\nNow, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:\n- Naomi: 68 points\n- Yuri: 44 points\n- Brianna: 85 points\n\nTo find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:\n\\[ 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " First, let's calculate how far Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he was traveling at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he covered is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\nDistance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours\nDistance = 30 miles\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it takes him to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We know that Distance = Speed × Time, so we can rearrange this formula to solve for Time:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nTime = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour\nTime = 5 hours\n\nSo, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.
