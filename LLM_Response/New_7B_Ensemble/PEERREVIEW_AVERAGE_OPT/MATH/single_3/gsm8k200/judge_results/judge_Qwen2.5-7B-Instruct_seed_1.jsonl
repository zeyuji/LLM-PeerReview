Since there are three colors (red, white, and purple), and half the mural is yellow, each of the three colors must make up 1/4 of the total mural area.\n\n2. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Since each color makes up 1/4 of the total, we can find the amount of each color by multiplying the total amount of paint by 1/4.\n\n3.

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \\frac{\\text{Jamal's phone capacity}}{6} \\]\n\nGiven that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we substitute this value into our equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \\frac{1800}{6} = 300 \\]\n\nSo, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.\n\nNext, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10.\n3. Since Bahati scored the most points, we can assume that B > A > D.\n4. From the second equation, we can write D = B - 10.\n5. Substitute this into the first equation: A + 20 = B - 10 + B.\n6. Simplify the equation: A + 20 = 2B - 10.\n7. Add 10 to both sides: A + 30 = 2B.\n8. Divide both sides by 2: A + 15 = B.\n9. Since A < B, we can conclude that A + 15 is less than B.\n10. Since A + 20 = B, we can conclude that B - A = 20.\n11. From the previous step, we know that A + 15 < B. So, A < B - 15.\n12. Since A + 15 < B and B - A = 20, we can conclude that A + 15 + A = 20 + B.\n13. Simplify the equation: 2A = 20 + B - A.\n14. Solve for A: A = (20 + B) / 3.\n15. Since A is an integer and B is greater than A, we can assume that B is also an integer.\n16. Since 20 + B is an even number, B must be odd for A to be an integer.\n17. Let's test some values for B: if B = 21, then A = (20 + 21) / 3 = 13 2/3, which is not an integer. If B = 23, then A = (20 + 23) / 3 = 14, which is an integer.\n18. So, the number of points Bahati scored is 23, Azibo scored 14, and Dinar scored 14 - 10 = 4.\n\nThe answer is: Azibo scored 14 points.</s>", "idx": 44, "selected_model": 1}

He watched a 1-hour episode each night, so that's 2 hours in total.\nStep 3:  On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of episodes as $x$. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is $30x$ minutes.\nStep 4:  On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours.\nStep 5:  On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is equivalent to 2 hours.\nStep 6:  The total time he watched TV is given as 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this: $2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $x$, we get $30x = 7 - 2 - 1.5 - 2 = 1.5$.

This means it loses 45% of its total capacity (5 hours * 9% per hour). So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is \\(x - 45\\%\\).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the charge remaining after an additional 3 hours of losing 7% of the total capacity each hour.\nAfter the first 5 hours, the power bank has \\(x - 45\\%\\) charge left. For the next 3 hours, it loses 7% of its capacity each hour, which is a total of 21% (3 hours * 7% per hour). So, the charge remaining after the additional 3 hours is \\((x - 45\\%) - 21\\%\\).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for the charge remaining after 8 hours.\nCombining the losses, the charge remaining after 8 hours is \\((x - 45\\%) - 21\\% = x - 66\\%\\).\n\n## Step 5: Set up the equation based on the final charge remaining.\nWe are told that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation \\(x - 66\\% = 28\\%\\).\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for \\(x\\).\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we need to isolate \\(x\\) on one side of the equation. Adding 66% to both sides gives us \\(x = 28\\% + 66\\%\\).\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of 28% and 66%.\n\\(x = 28\\% + 66\\% = 94\\%\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{94}$\n\nThis solution assumes that the power bank's capacity is 100% when fully charged, and it loses a certain percentage of its capacity each hour. The problem states that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%, which is used to solve for the initial charge.
