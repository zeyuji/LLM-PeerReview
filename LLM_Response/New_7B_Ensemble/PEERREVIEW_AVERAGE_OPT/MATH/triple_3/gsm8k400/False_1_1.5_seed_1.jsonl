To find the premium, we need to multiply the total cost of the ring by 30% (or 0.3).  This is equal to 0.3 x $900 = $270.

Since each CD costs $4, we divide the total amount he could have spent on CDs by the cost of one CD:\n\nNumber of CDs = Amount for CDs / Cost per CD\n              = $44 / $4\n              = 11\n\nSo, Tom could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphones.\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphones. Since he originally bought 1 CD, we subtract the number of CDs he could have bought from the number he actually bought:\n\nAdditional CDs = Number of CDs he could have bought - Number of CDs he actually bought\n               = 11 - 1\n               = 10\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'Tom would have been able to buy 10 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.'<|im_end|>", "idx": 360, "selected_model": 2}
