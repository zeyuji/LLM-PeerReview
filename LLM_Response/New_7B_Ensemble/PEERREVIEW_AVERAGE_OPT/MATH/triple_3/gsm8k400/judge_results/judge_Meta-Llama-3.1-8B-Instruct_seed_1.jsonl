The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many books fit into the shelving system without any additional ones. Since it's a 6x6 grid, the total number of spaces (and thus potential spots for books) is:\n\\[ \\text{Total spaces} = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\]\n\nNow, we're told Wendy wants to place \"double the number of books\" plus an additional 20 books. So, if \\(B\\) represents the number of books that would fill all 36 spaces without any extra, then the equation based on the problem statement is:\n\\[ \\text{Books needed} = 2B + 20 \\]\n\nBut remember, \\(B\\) itself is equal to the total number of spaces, which is 36. So, substituting \\(B\\) with 36 gives us:\n\\[ \\text{Books needed} = 2(36) + 20 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Books needed} = 72 + 20 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Books needed} = 92 \\]\n\nTherefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. \n\nThe answer is {answer} is 92.<|im_end|>", "idx": 200, "selected_model": 2}
