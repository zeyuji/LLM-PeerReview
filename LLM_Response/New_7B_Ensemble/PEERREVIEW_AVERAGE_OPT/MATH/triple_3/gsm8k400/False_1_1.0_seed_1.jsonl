{"task_name": "gsm8k400", "generation": " To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 400 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula for time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ miles}}{400 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.\n\nThe answer is 5.<|endoftext|>", "idx": 397, "selected_model": 3}

Kael brought twice the amount of apples Morisette brought, so Kael brought 5 * 2 = 10 apples.\n3. Morisette brought 8 oranges.\n4. Kael brought half the number of oranges Morisette brought, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.\n5. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and oranges for both Morisette and Kael: 5 (apples from Morisette) + 10 (apples from Kael) + 8 (oranges from Morisette) + 4 (oranges from Kael) = 27 fruits.\n\nThe answer is {27}.</s>", "idx": 398, "selected_model": 1}
