At the time Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim: \\(J = 2I\\).\n2. Now, John is 28 years old.\n\nSince Digimon came out 20 years ago, we can express John's current age as \\(J + 20\\), which equals 28. Therefore,\n\n\\[J + 20 = 28\\]\n\nSolving for \\(J\\):\n\n\\[J = 28 - 20\\]\n\\[J = 8\\]\n\nNow that we know John was 8 years old when Digimon came out, we can find Jim's age using the first equation:\n\n\\[J = 2I\\]\n\\[8 = 2I\\]\n\nSolving for \\(I\\):\n\n\\[I = \\frac{8}{2}\\]\n\\[I = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out.
