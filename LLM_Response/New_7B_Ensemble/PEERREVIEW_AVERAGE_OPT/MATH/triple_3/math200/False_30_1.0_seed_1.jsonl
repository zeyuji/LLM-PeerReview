The distance traveled by point $B$ during the quarter-circle roll is the circumference of a full circle divided by 4 (since only a quarter of the circle is rolled).

To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection points of the two equations and then count the lattice points within the enclosed region.\n\n## Step 1: Find the intersection points of the two equations\nTo find the intersection points, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. We have $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2+6$. Setting them equal, we get $|x|=-x^2+6$. We need to consider two cases: when $x\\geq 0$ and when $x<0$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for x when $x\\geq 0$\nWhen $x\\geq 0$, we have $x=-x^2+6$. Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2+x-6=0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x+3)(x-2)=0$. Solving for x, we get $x=-3$ or $x=2$. However, since we are considering the case when $x\\geq 0$, we discard the solution $x=-3$. Therefore, the only intersection point in this case is $x=2$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for x when $x<0$\nWhen $x<0$, we have $-x=-x^2+6$. Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2-x-6=0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x-3)(x+2)=0$. Solving for x, we get $x=3$ or $x=-2$. However, since we are considering the case when $x<0$, we discard the solution $x=3$. Therefore, the only intersection point in this case is $x=-2$.\n\n## Step 4: Count the lattice points within the enclosed region\nNow that we have found the intersection points, we can count the lattice points within the enclosed region. We need to consider the x-values from -2 to 2, inclusive. For each x-value, we need to find the corresponding y-values that satisfy both equations.\n\n## Step 5: Count the lattice points for each x-value\nWhen $x=-2$, the only lattice point is $(-2,2)$. When $x=-1$, the lattice points are $(-1,1)$ and $(-1,5)$. When $x=0$, the lattice points are $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,6)$. When $x=1$, the lattice points are $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$. When $x=2$, the only lattice point is $(2,2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Count the total number of lattice points\nAdding up the lattice points from each x-value, we get a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9 lattice points on the boundary.

We can see that there are 10 additional lattice points inside the region.\n\n## Step 7: Add the lattice points on the boundary and inside the region\nAdding the lattice points on the boundary and inside the region, we get a total of 9 + 10 = 19 lattice points.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$\n\nThis problem can be solved by finding the intersection points of the two equations and then counting the lattice points within the enclosed region.
