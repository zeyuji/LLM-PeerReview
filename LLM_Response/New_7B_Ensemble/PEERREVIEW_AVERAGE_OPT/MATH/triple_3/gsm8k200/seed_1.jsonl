{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels and then use that information to find out how long it takes for him to return.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since his ship travels at 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance \\( D \\) can be calculated as:\n\\[ D = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} = 10 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 30 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes for Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time \\( T \\) required to travel the same distance can be found using the formula:\n\\[ T = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{30 \\, \\text{miles}}{6 \\, \\text{mph}} = 5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the time it takes Tom to get back is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\] \n\nSo, the answer is 5.<|endoftext|>", "idx": 199, "selected_model": 3}
