Then the first house needs x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*(x/2) = x cases. The total number of cases is 250, so x + x/2 + x = 250. Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get 2x + x + 2x = 500. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 500. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 100. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*(x/2) = 2*50 = 100 cases. The answer is 100. \n\nI used the variable x to represent the number of cases the second house needs. I then used the information given in the problem to set up an equation. I solved the equation to find the value of x, and then used that value to find the number of cases the third house needs. This is an example of a system of linear equations, but it is not necessary to use that term to solve the problem. The key is to use the information given in the problem to set up an equation, and then solve the equation to find the answer. \n\nThis problem is an example of a word problem, which is a type of math problem that involves a real-world scenario.

So, first find half of Naomi's score: \\( \\frac{68}{2} = 34 \\). Then add 10 to this: \\( 34 + 10 = 44 \\) points.\n\n3. **Brianna's Score**: Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, add 17 to Naomi's score: \\( 68 + 17 = 85 \\) points.\n\n4. **Total Points Scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna**: Add their scores together: \\( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \\) points.\n\n5. **Total Points Scored by All Four Students**: The total is given as 251 points.\n\n6. **Jojo's Score**: To find out how many points Jojo scored, subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total: \\( 251 - 197 = 54 \\) points.\n\nTherefore, Jojo scored **54 points**.<|im_end|>", "idx": 198, "selected_model": 2}
{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels and then use that information to find out how long it takes for him to return.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since his ship travels at 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance \\( D \\) can be calculated as:\n\\[ D = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} = 10 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 30 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes for Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time \\( T \\) required to travel the same distance can be found using the formula:\n\\[ T = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{30 \\, \\text{miles}}{6 \\, \\text{mph}} = 5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the time it takes Tom to get back is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\] \n\nSo, the answer is 5.<|endoftext|>", "idx": 199, "selected_model": 3}
