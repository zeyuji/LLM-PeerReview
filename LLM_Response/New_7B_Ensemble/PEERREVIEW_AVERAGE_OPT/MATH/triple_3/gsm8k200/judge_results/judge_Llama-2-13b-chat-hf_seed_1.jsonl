{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " is 4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws used.  The answer is 8. \nThe answer is 8. \n\nExplanation: \nTo find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to first calculate how many screws he will use in total.  We know that each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, so we can multiply the number of legs by the number of screws per leg to get the total number of screws used per table.  This is 4 legs x 2 screws = 8 screws per table.  Since James is putting together 4 tables, we can multiply the number of screws used per table by the number of tables to get the total number of screws used.  This is 8 screws per table x 4 tables = 32 screws used.  To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has.  This is 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over.  Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over. \n\nNote: The problem statement is a bit confusing, as it says '4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws used', which is not a correct mathematical operation.

Then the first house needs x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*(x/2) = x cases. The total number of cases is 250, so x + x/2 + x = 250. Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get 2x + x + 2x = 500. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 500. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 100. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*(x/2) = 2*50 = 100 cases. The answer is 100. \n\nI used the variable x to represent the number of cases the second house needs. I then used the information given in the problem to set up an equation. I solved the equation to find the value of x, and then used that value to find the number of cases the third house needs.

This type of problem is often used to assess a student's ability to apply math to real-world situations. \n\nIn this problem, the student is required to use algebraic thinking to solve the problem. They must use variables to represent unknown values, and then use equations to solve for those values. This type of thinking is an important part of algebra, and is also used in many other areas of math. \n\nThe student is also required to use critical thinking skills to solve the problem. They must read and understand the problem, and then use math to solve it.

Since 4 small masks can be made with 2 yards of material, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks to get the material needed for one small mask. This gives us 2 / 4 = 0.5 yards per small mask.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the material needed for 20 small masks\nNow that we know one small mask requires 0.5 yards of material, we multiply this by the number of small masks Jo wants to make, which is 20. So, 0.5 yards per mask * 20 masks = 10 yards.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the material needed for large masks\nNext, we calculate the material needed for one large mask. Since 3 large masks can be made with 2.25 yards of material, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks to get the material needed for one large mask. This gives us 2.25 / 3 = 0.75 yards per large mask.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the material needed for 8 large masks\nNow that we know one large mask requires 0.75 yards of material, we multiply this by the number of large masks Jo wants to make, which is 8. So, 0.75 yards per mask * 8 masks = 6 yards.\n\n## Step 5: Add the material needed for small and large masks\nTo find the total amount of material needed, we add the material required for the small masks (10 yards) to the material required for the large masks (6 yards). This gives us 10 + 6 = 16 yards.\n\n## Step 6: Round up to the nearest quarter yard if necessary\nSince the problem involves working with yards and the question implies a need for a precise answer, we should ensure our final calculation is accurate.

This gives us 2 / 4 = 0.5 yards per small mask.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the material needed for 20 small masks\nNow that we know one small mask requires 0.5 yards of material, we multiply this by the number of small masks Jo wants to make, which is 20. So, 0.5 yards per mask * 20 masks = 10 yards.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the material needed for large masks\nNext, we calculate the material needed for one large mask. Since 3 large masks can be made with 2.25 yards of material, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks to get the material needed for one large mask. This gives us 2.25 / 3 = 0.75 yards per large mask.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the material needed for 8 large masks\nNow that we know one large mask requires 0.75 yards of material, we multiply this by the number of large masks Jo wants to make, which is 8. So, 0.75 yards per mask * 8 masks = 6 yards.\n\n## Step 5: Add the material needed for small and large masks\nTo find the total amount of material needed, we add the material required for the small masks (10 yards) to the material required for the large masks (6 yards). This gives us 10 + 6 = 16 yards.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the total material needed to yards and quarters\nSince 2.25 yards is equivalent to 2 and 1/4 yards, we can see that 2.25 yards is 2.25/2.25 = 1 quarter yard. We need to find out how many quarters of a yard are in 16 yards. 16 yards is equal to 16 * 4 = 64 quarters of a yard.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total material needed in quarters of a yard\nWe need to find out how many quarters of a yard are in 2.25 yards. 2.25 yards is equal to 2.25 * 4 = 9 quarters of a yard.
