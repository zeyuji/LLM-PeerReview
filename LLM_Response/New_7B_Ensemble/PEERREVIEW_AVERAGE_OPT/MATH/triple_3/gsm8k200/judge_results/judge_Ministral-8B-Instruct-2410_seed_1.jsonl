The key is to use the information given in the problem to set up an equation, and then solve the equation to find the answer. \n\nThis problem is an example of a word problem, which is a type of math problem that involves a real-world scenario. It requires the student to read and understand the problem, and then use math to solve it. This type of problem is often used to assess a student's ability to apply math to real-world situations. \n\nIn this problem, the student is required to use algebraic thinking to solve the problem. They must use variables to represent unknown values, and then use equations to solve for those values. This type of thinking is an important part of algebra, and is also used in many other areas of math. \n\nThe student is also required to use critical thinking skills to solve the problem. They must read and understand the problem, and then use math to solve it. This requires the student to think critically about the information given in the problem, and to use that information to make logical conclusions. \n\nOverall, this problem is a good example of a math problem that requires the student to use algebraic thinking and critical thinking skills to solve.

This means it loses 45% of its total capacity (5 hours * 9% per hour). So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is \\(x - 45\\%\\).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the charge remaining after an additional 3 hours of losing 7% of the total capacity each hour.\nAfter the first 5 hours, the power bank has \\(x - 45\\%\\) charge left. For the next 3 hours, it loses 7% of its capacity each hour, which is a total of 21% (3 hours * 7% per hour). So, the charge remaining after the additional 3 hours is \\((x - 45\\%) - 21\\%\\).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for the charge remaining after 8 hours.\nCombining the losses, the charge remaining after 8 hours is \\((x - 45\\%) - 21\\% = x - 66\\%\\).\n\n## Step 5: Set up the equation based on the final charge remaining.\nWe are told that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation \\(x - 66\\% = 28\\%\\).\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for \\(x\\).\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we need to isolate \\(x\\) on one side of the equation. Adding 66% to both sides gives us \\(x = 28\\% + 66\\%\\).\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of 28% and 66%.\n\\(x = 28\\% + 66\\% = 94\\%\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{94}$\n\nThis solution assumes that the power bank's capacity is 100% when fully charged, and it loses a certain percentage of its capacity each hour. The problem states that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%, which is used to solve for the initial charge. The calculation is straightforward, and the final answer is the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.  The answer is 94.  The answer is 94.  The answer is 94.
