We can approach this by working backwards from the end, considering the constraints imposed by the divisibility rule.\n\nLet's consider the possible endings for our sequence based on the divisibility rule:\n\n1. If the last digit is 9, the second-to-last digit must be 1 (to form 91, which is not divisible by 19 or 31), so this doesn't work.\n2.

However, since \\(\\arccos\\) only outputs values between 0 and \\(\\pi\\), we are interested in how \\(\\sin x\\) maps into this range.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Function's Behavior\n\nConsider the properties of \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\arccos\\):\n- For \\(0 \\le x \\le \\pi\\), \\(\\sin x\\) increases from 0 to 1, so \\(\\arccos(\\sin x)\\) decreases from \\(\\pi/2\\) to 0.\n- For \\(\\pi \\le x \\le 2\\pi\\), \\(\\sin x\\) decreases from 1 back to 0, so \\(\\arccos(\\sin x)\\) increases from 0 to \\(\\pi/2\\).\n- This pattern repeats every \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Function Over the Given Interval\n\nGiven the interval \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\), we can see it spans one full cycle of the pattern described above plus an additional half-cycle.\n\n#### Within \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\):\n- The function behaves as described above, forming a triangle with base \\(\\pi\\) and height \\(\\pi/2\\).\n\n#### From \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\):\n- This is another half-cycle, mirroring the behavior from \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) to \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), thus forming another triangle with the same dimensions.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Area\n\nEach triangle has a base of \\(\\pi\\) and a height of \\(\\pi/2\\). The area of a triangle is given by:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\]\n\nThus, the area of one triangle is:\n\\[A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\pi \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\]\n\nSince there are two such triangles (one for each half-cycle within the given interval), the total area is:\n\\[A_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times A_{\\text{triangle}} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe area bounded by the graph of \\(y = \\arccos(\\sin x)\\) and the \\(x\\)-axis on the interval \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}}\n\\]<|im_end|>", "idx": 12, "selected_model": 2}

{"task_name": "math400", "generation": " To find the area of triangle $ABC$, we can use the fact that $\\angle A = 45^\\circ$ and the given lengths $BD = 2$ and $CD = 3$. Since $D$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$, we have two right triangles, $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ACD$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the length of $AD$. Since $\\angle A = 45^\\circ$, both $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ACD$ are 45-45-90 triangles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a leg.\n\nFor $\\triangle ABD$, since $BD = 2$, it follows that $AD = BD = 2$ because $AD$ is a leg of the 45-45-90 triangle $\\triangle ABD$.\n\nNow, for $\\triangle ACD$, since $CD = 3$, it follows that $AD = CD = 3$ because $AD$ is a leg of the 45-45-90 triangle $\\triangle ACD$. However, this contradicts our previous finding that $AD = 2$. This discrepancy arises from an oversight in interpreting the given information correctly. The correct approach is to recognize that $AD$ is common to both triangles and should not be directly equated with either $BD$ or $CD$ based on their lengths alone. Instead, we should use the properties of 45-45-90 triangles to find the lengths of $AB$ and $AC$.\n\nGiven that $BD = 2$ and $CD = 3$, we can find $BC$ by adding these lengths together, as $D$ lies on $\\overline{BC}$:\n\\[BC = BD + CD = 2 + 3 = 5.\\]\n\nSince $\\angle A = 45^\\circ$, we know that $\\triangle ABC$ is also a 45-45-90 triangle (because $\\angle A$ is the only angle given, and the triangle is acute). Therefore, $AB = AC$.\n\nTo find $AB$ (or $AC$), we can use the relationship in a 45-45-90 triangle where the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a leg. Here, $BC$ acts as the hypotenuse of the larger triangle formed by extending $AD$ to meet $BC$ at a right angle. Thus, we have:\n\\[AB = AC = \\frac{BC}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\\]\n\nThe area of triangle $ABC$ can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Here, we can take $AB$ as the base and $AD$ as the height (since $AD$ is perpendicular to $BC$):\n\\[\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times AD = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 2 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$. \n\nHowever, the question asks for a single numerical number. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the final step. Given the context and the provided solution process, the correct numerical answer considering the typical expectation for such problems would be derived from the calculation without leaving the expression in radical form. The correct numerical value, after simplifying the expression, is:\n\n\\[\\text{Area} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 1.414}{2} = \\frac{7.07}{2} = 3.535...\\]\n\nRounded to one decimal place, the area is approximately $3.5$.

This is because the hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles (since it's regular), and each perpendicular cuts through two of these triangles.\n\nLet's calculate the area of the hexagon using the perpendiculars. The area of a triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). For our hexagon, the base is \\(s\\) and the height is the perpendicular length.

In other words, if we have two sets $A$ and $B$, then $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.\n\nGiven the set $\\mathcal{S}$, we can think of each element having three possibilities:\n\n1. It can be in subset $A$.\n2. It can be in subset $B$.\n3. It can be in neither subset, which is not allowed since both subsets must be non-empty.\n\nSince there are $10$ elements in $\\mathcal{S}$, and each element has $3$ choices, one might initially think there are $3^{10}$ ways to assign elements to subsets $A$ and $B$. However, this counts every possible combination, including those where all elements are in one subset or both subsets are empty, which we don't want.\n\nTo correct for this, we subtract the cases where all elements are in one subset or both subsets are empty. There are $2$ ways to choose which subset contains all elements (either $A$ or $B$), and $1$ way to choose the case where both subsets are empty. So, we subtract these from our total:\n\n\\[3^{10} - 2 - 1 = 59049 - 3 = 59046.\\]\n\nHowever, this still counts the cases where one subset is empty, which we're not interested in because both subsets must be non-empty. Each element has $2$ choices (either in $A$ or $B$) when considering only non-empty subsets, leading to $2^{10}$ ways to assign elements to non-empty subsets. But again, this counts every possible combination, including those where all elements are in one subset, which we've already accounted for.\n\nSo, the number of ways to divide $\\mathcal{S}$ into two non-empty disjoint subsets is simply $2^{10}$, because each element has $2$ choices (either in $A$ or $B$), and there are $10$ elements.\n\nTherefore, $n = 2^{10} = 1024$.\n\nFinally, finding the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$:\n\n\\[1024 \\mod 1000 = 24.\\]\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{24}$.<|im_end|>", "idx": 230, "selected_model": 2}

For \\(200!\\):\n\\[ \\text{Number of 5s} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49 \\]\n\n3.

{"task_name": "math400", "generation": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we will first find the base $-n+i$ expansions for the integers from 0 to $n^2$. Since $-n+i$ is a complex number with a non-zero real part and a non-zero imaginary part, its powers will spiral around the origin in a counterclockwise direction. This means that the digits in the base $-n+i$ expansion will alternate between the real and imaginary parts of the powers of $-n+i$.\n\nLet's start by finding the expansions for the integers from 0 to $n$. For $k=0$, the expansion is simply $(0)_{-n+i}=0$. For $k=1$, the expansion is $(1)_{-n+i}=(-n+i)$. For $k=2$, the expansion is $(2)_{-n+i}=(-n+i)^2+(-n+i)=(n^2-2n+1)_{-n+i}$. Continuing this pattern, we can find the expansions for all integers from 0 to $n$.\n\nNow, let's find the expansions for the integers from $n+1$ to $n^2$. Since the powers of $-n+i$ are periodic with period $n$, we can find the expansions for these integers by adding $n$ to the expansions we found for the integers from 0 to $n$. For example, $(n+1)_{-n+i}=(n)_{-n+i}+n=(n^2-n+1)_{-n+i}$. Continuing this pattern, we can find the expansions for all integers from $n+1$ to $n^2$.\n\nNow, let's find the four-digit expansions for the integers from 0 to $n^2$ that have $a_3\\ne 0$. Since $a_3$ must be non-zero, the third digit in the expansion must be non-zero. This means that the third digit can only be one of the numbers from $1$ to $n$. If the third digit is $k$, then the fourth digit must be the remainder when $k$ is divided by $n$. Since $n$ is a positive integer, the fourth digit can only be one of the numbers from 0 to $n-1$.\n\nTherefore, there are $n$ possible four-digit expansions with $a_3\\ne 0$. To find the sum of these integers, we can simply add up the expansions for each of the $n$ possibilities.\n\nThe answer is the sum of the four-digit expansions with $a_3\\ne 0$.

Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the possible slopes for the line $\\overline{AB}$ in the given isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$.\nStep 2:  We are given the coordinates of points $A$ and $D$, which are $(20,100)$ and $(21,107)$, respectively. Since the trapezoid has no horizontal or vertical sides, the line $\\overline{AB}$ must have a slope that is not $0$ or undefined.\nStep 3:  We can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, which will be the same as the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 4:  Applying the midpoint formula to the coordinates of $A$ and $D$, we get the midpoint as $\\left(\\frac{20+21}{2},\\frac{100+107}{2}\\right)=(\\frac{41}{2},\\frac{207}{2})$.\nStep 5:  Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the line $\\overline{BC}$ must be parallel to $\\overline{AD}$, and the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ must be the same as the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$. This means that the line $\\overline{BC}$ must have the same slope as $\\overline{AD}$.\nStep 6:  The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. Therefore, the slope of $\\overline{AD}$ is $\\frac{107-100}{21-20}=7$.\nStep 7:  Since the line $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to $\\overline{AD}$, it must have the same slope, which is $7$. However, the trapezoid has no horizontal or vertical sides, so the line $\\overline{AB}$ must have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $7$, which is $-\\frac{1}{7}$.\nStep 8:  Additionally, the line $\\overline{AB}$ can also have a slope of $7$ if the trapezoid is rotated $90^\\circ$ clockwise. This means that the line $\\overline{AB}$ can have two possible slopes: $7$ and $-\\frac{1}{7}$.\nStep 9:  The sum of the absolute values of these slopes is $|7|+|-\\frac{1}{7}|=7+\\frac{1}{7}=\\frac{50}{7}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the sum of the absolute values of all possible slopes for $\\overline{AB}$ is $\\frac{50}{7}$, and the final answer is $m+n=50+7=\\boxed{57}$.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the sum of the absolute values of all possible slopes for $\\overline{AB}$, which is $m/n$. In this case, $m=50$ and $n=7$, so the sum of the absolute values of all possible slopes for $\\overline{AB}$ is $m+n=50+7=57$. But the problem asks for the sum of the absolute values of all possible slopes for $\\overline{AB}$, which is $m/n$.

{"task_name": "math400", "generation": " To solve this problem, we need to use properties of cyclic polygons and symmetry. Let's denote the vertices of the hexagon as \\(A, B, C, D, E, F\\) in order around the circle, with \\(AB = 31\\) and the other five sides each equal to 81.\n\nSince the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, it is a cyclic hexagon. The key observation here is that the hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids by drawing the diameter through the vertices \\(A\\) and \\(D\\). This means that the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(DE\\) are opposite each other, and so are \\(BC\\) and \\(EF\\), and \\(CD\\) and \\(FA\\).\n\nGiven that five sides are equal and one side is different, the hexagon must be symmetric about the diameter passing through \\(A\\) and \\(D\\). Therefore, the diagonals \\(AC\\), \\(AD\\), and \\(AF\\) will all be equal in length because they are all diameters of the circle.\n\nTo find the length of these diagonals, we can use Ptolemy's theorem in the cyclic quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\). Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\), the product of the lengths of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides:\n\\[ AC \\cdot BD = AB \\cdot CD + AD \\cdot BC. \\]\n\nHowever, since \\(AB = 31\\) and the other four sides are 81, and knowing that \\(AC = AD = AF\\) (as they are all diameters), we can simplify our approach by recognizing that the length of the diagonal is simply the diameter of the circle. We can use the fact that the hexagon can be split into two congruent trapezoids, and the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side in the trapezoid.\n\nThe length of the diagonal \\(AC\\) (which is the same as \\(AD\\) and \\(AF\\)) can be found using the fact that the hexagon can be split into two congruent trapezoids, and the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side in the trapezoid. By symmetry and the properties of the circle, the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle.\n\nUsing the fact that the hexagon can be split into two congruent trapezoids, and the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, we can conclude that the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle. The length of the diagonal is therefore the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle.\n\nThus, the length of each diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle. The length of the diagonal is therefore:\n\\[ AC = AD = AF = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{area of the hexagon}}{\\text{sum of the lengths of the sides}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{area of the hexagon}}{5 \\times 81 + 31} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{area of the hexagon}}{442}. \\]\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to recognize that the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle. The length of the diagonal is therefore:\n\\[ AC = AD = AF = \\sqrt{81^2 + 31^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 961} = \\sqrt{7522} = 81 + 31 = 112. \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the lengths of the three diagonals from \\(A\\) is:\n\\[ AC + AD + AF = 112 + 112 + 112 = 336. \\]\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{336}\\).<|endoftext|>", "idx": 398, "selected_model": 3}
