Since the first digit is given as 1, we start with 1_ (where \"_\" represents an unknown digit).\n\nTo maximize the last digit, we should aim to construct a sequence that ends with the highest possible digit while adhering to the divisibility rule. We can approach this by working backwards from the end, considering the constraints imposed by the divisibility rule.\n\nLet's consider the possible endings for our sequence based on the divisibility rule:\n\n1. If the last digit is 9, the second-to-last digit must be 1 (to form 91, which is not divisible by 19 or 31), so this doesn't work.\n2. If the last digit is 8, the second-to-last digit could be 3 (to form 83, which is divisible by 31).\n3. Continuing this logic, if the second-to-last digit is 3, the third-to-last digit must be 9 (to form 39, which is divisible by 19).\n4. If the third-to-last digit is 9, the fourth-to-last digit must be 1 (to form 91, which is not divisible by 19 or 31), but since we're working backwards, this doesn't directly help us determine the maximum last digit.\n\nHowever, focusing on maximizing the last digit while ensuring all two-digit combinations are valid, we see that starting with 1 and aiming for a high last digit, we can construct a sequence like this: 193893193893...\n\nThis sequence alternates between 19 and 38, ensuring divisibility by 19 or 31 for every two-digit combination.

Specifically, we aim to find a direct relation between $AF$ and $AT$ without explicitly calculating $FD$, $BT$, $EF$, or $CT$.\n\nRecall that the Angle Bisector Theorem gives us the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$ as $3:4$. This ratio also applies to the segments created by the angle bisector on the opposite side, implying that the entire segment $AT$ is divided in the same ratio by point $F$ when considering the entire length of $AB$ and $AC$.\n\nTherefore, if we consider the entire length of $AT$ as being divided in the ratio $3:4$ by point $F$, it implies that $F$ divides $AT$ in the same ratio as $AB$ to $AC$, which is $3:4$.\n\nThus, the fraction of $AF$ to $AT$ is directly related to the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$, which is $3:7$ (since $AB:AC = 3:4$ and considering the whole segment $AT$).\n\nHence,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{AF}{AT} = \\frac{3}{7}\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}\n\\]<|im_end|>", "idx": 101, "selected_model": 2}

Since $D$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$, we have two right triangles, $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ACD$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the length of $AD$. Since $\\angle A = 45^\\circ$, both $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ACD$ are 45-45-90 triangles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a leg.\n\nFor $\\triangle ABD$, since $BD = 2$, it follows that $AD = BD = 2$ because $AD$ is a leg of the 45-45-90 triangle $\\triangle ABD$.\n\nNow, for $\\triangle ACD$, since $CD = 3$, it follows that $AD = CD = 3$ because $AD$ is a leg of the 45-45-90 triangle $\\triangle ACD$. However, this contradicts our previous finding that $AD = 2$. This discrepancy arises from an oversight in interpreting the given information correctly. The correct approach is to recognize that $AD$ is common to both triangles and should not be directly equated with either $BD$ or $CD$ based on their lengths alone. Instead, we should use the properties of 45-45-90 triangles to find the lengths of $AB$ and $AC$.\n\nGiven that $BD = 2$ and $CD = 3$, we can find $BC$ by adding these lengths together, as $D$ lies on $\\overline{BC}$:\n\\[BC = BD + CD = 2 + 3 = 5.\\]\n\nSince $\\angle A = 45^\\circ$, we know that $\\triangle ABC$ is also a 45-45-90 triangle (because $\\angle A$ is the only angle given, and the triangle is acute). Therefore, $AB = AC$.\n\nTo find $AB$ (or $AC$), we can use the relationship in a 45-45-90 triangle where the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a leg. Here, $BC$ acts as the hypotenuse of the larger triangle formed by extending $AD$ to meet $BC$ at a right angle. Thus, we have:\n\\[AB = AC = \\frac{BC}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\\]\n\nThe area of triangle $ABC$ can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Here, we can take $AB$ as the base and $AD$ as the height (since $AD$ is perpendicular to $BC$):\n\\[\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times AD = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 2 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$. \n\nHowever, the question asks for a single numerical number. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the final step. Given the context and the provided solution process, the correct numerical answer considering the typical expectation for such problems would be derived from the calculation without leaving the expression in radical form. The correct numerical value, after simplifying the expression, is:\n\n\\[\\text{Area} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 1.414}{2} = \\frac{7.07}{2} = 3.535...\\]\n\nRounded to one decimal place, the area is approximately $3.5$.

Since $a, b, c, d$ are nonnegative real numbers and their sum is 1, we can think of them as the probabilities of four mutually exclusive events.\n\n2. Let's consider the events $A, B, C, D$ corresponding to $a, b, c, d$ respectively. The probability of at least two of these events occurring is given by the sum of probabilities of the following three cases:\n   - $A \\cap B \\cap C \\cap D$ (all four events occur)\n   - $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C) \\cup (A \\cap D) \\cup (B \\cap C) \\cup (B \\cap D) \\cup (C \\cap D)$ (exactly three events occur)\n   - $(A \\cup B) \\cup (A \\cup C) \\cup (A \\cup D) \\cup (B \\cup C) \\cup (B \\cup D) \\cup (C \\cup D)$ (at least two events occur)\n\n3. The probability of all four events occurring is $a^4$. The probability of exactly three events occurring is $3 \\cdot (a^3 \\cdot (1-a))$. The probability of at least two events occurring is the sum of these two probabilities.\n\n4. We want to maximize the sum $ab + bc + cd$, which is equal to the probability of at least two events occurring minus the probability of all four events occurring. So, we need to find the maximum value of $3 \\cdot (a^3 \\cdot (1-a)) - a^4$.\n\n5. Differentiating the expression with respect to $a$ and setting it equal to zero, we get $3 \\cdot (3a^2 - 1) - 4a^3 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation, we find that $a = \\frac{1}{4}$ is a solution.\n\n6. To check if this is a maximum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative is $12a - 12a^2 - 12$, which is negative for $a > \\frac{1}{3}$ and positive for $a < \\frac{1}{3}$. Since $a > 0$, the maximum occurs at $a = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n7.

{"task_name": "math400", "generation": " the answer is 19. \nThe problem asks for the number of lattice points that are on the boundary or inside the region bounded by the equations $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2+6$. To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection points of the two equations and then count the lattice points within the enclosed region.\n\n## Step 1: Find the intersection points of the two equations\nTo find the intersection points, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. We have $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2+6$. Setting them equal, we get $|x|=-x^2+6$. We need to consider two cases: when $x\\geq 0$ and when $x<0$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for x when $x\\geq 0$\nWhen $x\\geq 0$, we have $x=-x^2+6$. Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2+x-6=0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x+3)(x-2)=0$. Solving for x, we get $x=-3$ or $x=2$. However, since we are considering the case when $x\\geq 0$, we discard the solution $x=-3$. Therefore, the only intersection point in this case is $x=2$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for x when $x<0$\nWhen $x<0$, we have $-x=-x^2+6$. Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2-x-6=0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x-3)(x+2)=0$. Solving for x, we get $x=3$ or $x=-2$. However, since we are considering the case when $x<0$, we discard the solution $x=3$. Therefore, the only intersection point in this case is $x=-2$.\n\n## Step 4: Count the lattice points within the enclosed region\nNow that we have found the intersection points, we can count the lattice points within the enclosed region. We need to consider the x-values from -2 to 2, inclusive. For each x-value, we need to find the corresponding y-values that satisfy both equations.\n\n## Step 5: Count the lattice points for each x-value\nWhen $x=-2$, the only lattice point is $(-2,2)$. When $x=-1$, the lattice points are $(-1,1)$ and $(-1,5)$. When $x=0$, the lattice points are $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,6)$. When $x=1$, the lattice points are $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$. When $x=2$, the only lattice point is $(2,2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Count the total number of lattice points\nAdding up the lattice points from each x-value, we get a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9 lattice points on the boundary. However, we need to include the lattice points inside the region. We can see that there are 10 additional lattice points inside the region.\n\n## Step 7: Add the lattice points on the boundary and inside the region\nAdding the lattice points on the boundary and inside the region, we get a total of 9 + 10 = 19 lattice points.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$\n\nThis problem can be solved by finding the intersection points of the two equations and then counting the lattice points within the enclosed region. The intersection points are $x=-2$ and $x=2$. The lattice points within the enclosed region are counted for each x-value from -2 to 2, inclusive. The total number of lattice points is 19. \n\nThe final answer is: the answer is 19.

Since the polynomial is monic (the leading coefficient is 1), the product of the roots is:\n\\[\nz_1 z_2 \\cdots z_{20} = 441.\n\\]\n\nNow, we use the fact that the sum of the arccotangents of the roots can be related to the argument of the product of the roots.

Therefore,\n\\[\n\\cot \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{20} \\operatorname{arccot} z_k \\right) = \\cot \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}.\n\\]<|endoftext|>", "idx": 188, "selected_model": 3}

The total value of the coins is \\$3.20, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ 0.25q + 0.05n = 3.20 \\]\n\nSince \\( q = n \\), we can substitute \\( n \\) with \\( q \\):\n\\[ 0.25q + 0.05q = 3.20 \\]\n\\[ 0.30q = 3.20 \\]\n\nTo find \\( q \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.30:\n\\[ q = \\frac{3.20}{0.30} \\]\n\\[ q = \\frac{320}{30} \\]\n\\[ q = \\frac{32}{3} \\]\n\\[ q \\approx 10.67 \\]\n\nSince \\( q \\) must be a whole number, we take the greatest integer less than or equal to 10.67, which is 10. Therefore, the greatest number of quarters Sasha could have is 10.\n\nTo verify, if \\( q = 10 \\), then \\( n = 10 \\). The value of the quarters is \\( 10 \\times 0.25 = 2.50 \\) dollars, and the value of the nickels is \\( 10 \\times 0.05 = 0.50 \\) dollars.

The value of the quarters is \\( 9 \\times 0.25 = 2.25 \\) dollars, and the value of the nickels is \\( 9 \\times 0.05 = 0.45 \\) dollars. The total value is:\n\\[ 2.25 + 0.45 = 2.70 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThis is still not \\$3.20, so we need to check if 8 quarters and 8 nickels would work:\nIf \\( q = 8 \\), then \\( n = 8 \\). The value of the quarters is \\( 8 \\times 0.25 = 2.00 \\) dollars, and the value of the nickels is \\( 8 \\times 0.05 = 0.40 \\) dollars. The total value is:\n\\[ 2.00 + 0.40 = 2.40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThis is still not \\$3.20, so we need to check if 7 quarters and 7 nickels would work:\nIf \\( q = 7 \\), then \\( n = 7 \\).

In other words, if we have two sets $A$ and $B$, then $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.\n\nGiven the set $\\mathcal{S}$, we can think of each element having three possibilities:\n\n1. It can be in subset $A$.\n2. It can be in subset $B$.\n3. It can be in neither subset, which is not allowed since both subsets must be non-empty.\n\nSince there are $10$ elements in $\\mathcal{S}$, and each element has $3$ choices, one might initially think there are $3^{10}$ ways to assign elements to subsets $A$ and $B$. However, this counts every possible combination, including those where all elements are in one subset or both subsets are empty, which we don't want.\n\nTo correct for this, we subtract the cases where all elements are in one subset or both subsets are empty. There are $2$ ways to choose which subset contains all elements (either $A$ or $B$), and $1$ way to choose the case where both subsets are empty. So, we subtract these from our total:\n\n\\[3^{10} - 2 - 1 = 59049 - 3 = 59046.\\]\n\nHowever, this still counts the cases where one subset is empty, which we're not interested in because both subsets must be non-empty. Each element has $2$ choices (either in $A$ or $B$) when considering only non-empty subsets, leading to $2^{10}$ ways to assign elements to non-empty subsets. But again, this counts every possible combination, including those where all elements are in one subset, which we've already accounted for.\n\nSo, the number of ways to divide $\\mathcal{S}$ into two non-empty disjoint subsets is simply $2^{10}$, because each element has $2$ choices (either in $A$ or $B$), and there are $10$ elements.\n\nTherefore, $n = 2^{10} = 1024$.\n\nFinally, finding the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$:\n\n\\[1024 \\mod 1000 = 24.\\]\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{24}$.<|im_end|>", "idx": 230, "selected_model": 2}

This means that the difference between any two consecutive terms is always one more than a multiple of $n!$.\n\n4. **Maximizing the GCD**:\n   The key insight here is that for any $n \\ge 1$, $n!$ contains all prime factors up to $n$. Therefore, the GCD of $n! + n$ and $(n+1)! + (n+1)$ cannot be greater than $n$ because $n! + n$ is not divisible by any prime greater than $n$ (since $n!$ already includes all such primes), and $(n+1)! + (n+1)$ is clearly not divisible by $n+1$ due to the \"+1\" term.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Given the above analysis, the maximum possible value of the GCD of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n = n! + n$ is when $n=1$.

{"task_name": "math400", "generation": "\nThe problem asks for the perimeter of pentagon $ABCDE$, which is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. To find the perimeter, we need to find the length of each side and add them up. Looking at the diagram, we can see that the lengths of the sides are given as $AB=1$, $BC=1$, $CD=1$, $DE=1$, and $AE$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $AD$ and $DE$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $AE$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have $AE^2=AD^2+DE^2$. We can find the length of $AD$ by using the fact that $AC=1$ and $CD=1$, so $AD=AC+CD=1+1=2$. Now we can find the length of $AE$ by plugging in the values of $AD$ and $DE$ into the Pythagorean theorem: $AE^2=AD^2+DE^2=2^2+1^2=4+1=5$, so $AE=\\sqrt{5}$.

This can be written as:\n\\[ 60 + n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n} \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ 60 \\equiv -n \\pmod{n} \\]\nor equivalently:\n\\[ 60 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n} \\]\nThis means that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 60. The divisors of 60 are: \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 \\). However, since \\( n \\) is a digit (i.e., \\( n \\) is between 0 and 9), we only consider the divisors of 60 that are digits. These are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\).\n\nWe now verify each of these values:\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 61 \\div 1 = 61 \\) (divisible)\n- For \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 62 \\div 2 = 31 \\) (divisible)\n- For \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 63 \\div 3 = 21 \\) (divisible)\n- For \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 64 \\div 4 = 16 \\) (divisible)\n- For \\( n = 5 \\): \\( 65 \\div 5 = 13 \\) (divisible)\n- For \\( n = 6 \\): \\( 66 \\div 6 = 11 \\) (divisible)\n\nAll these values satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are 6 different digits \\( n \\) for which the two-digit number \\( 6n \\) is divisible by \\( n \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).<|endoftext|>", "idx": 397, "selected_model": 3}
