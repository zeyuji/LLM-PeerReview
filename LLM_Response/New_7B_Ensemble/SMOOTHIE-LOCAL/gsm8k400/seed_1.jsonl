So, Corey is 7 years older than Jackson (5 + 2).\n2. We also know that James is 1 year younger than Corey and is 10 years old. So, Corey is 11 years old (10 + 1).\n3. Now we can find the age of Jackson by subtracting the age of Corey from his stated difference with Corey: 7 (Corey's age) - 11 (Corey's age) + Corey's age = 0. Solving for Corey's age gives us 7 - 11 + x = 0, which means x = 4. So, Corey is 4 years old.\n4. Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy is 2 - 4 = -2 years old. However, since people can't be negative age, we know that our initial assumption about Amy's age must be incorrect.\n5. Let's reconsider the ages of the children. Since Corey is 11 and James is 10, they can't both be older than Amy. So, let's assume that Amy is the oldest, followed by Corey, James, and then Jackson.\n6.

The total amount spent = $48\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much was spent on the headphone set. We do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount spent:\n\nAmount spent on headphones = Total amount - Cost of CD\n                           = $48 - $4\n                           = $44\n\nNow, we know that the headphone set cost $44.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphones. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the total amount he could have spent on CDs by the cost of one CD:\n\nNumber of CDs = Amount for CDs / Cost per CD\n              = $44 / $4\n              = 11\n\nSo, Tom could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphones.\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphones. Since he originally bought 1 CD, we subtract the number of CDs he could have bought from the number he actually bought:\n\nAdditional CDs = Number of CDs he could have bought - Number of CDs he actually bought\n               = 11 - 1\n               = 10\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'Tom would have been able to buy 10 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.'<|im_end|>", "idx": 360, "selected_model": 2, "smoothie_weights": [0.28197241084171826, 0.11584260664398044, 0.4152554658158827, 0.18692951669841854]}

Therefore, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\]\n\nThis gives us the equation:\n\\[ C + B = 10 \\]\n\nNow we substitute the expression for \\( B \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( C \\):\n\\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \\]\n\\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \\]\n\\[ 4C = 12 \\]\n\\[ C = 3 \\]\n\nSo, Carly made 3 cupcakes.
