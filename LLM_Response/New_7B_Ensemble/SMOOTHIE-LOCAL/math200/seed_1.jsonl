{"task_name": "math200", "generation": " the answer is 1. \n## Step 1:  To find the remainder when the polynomial $x^{18}+x^{13}+x^7+x^4+x$ is divided by $x^3-x$, we can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. However, given the complexity of the polynomial, it might be more efficient to use the Remainder Theorem.\n## Step 2:  The Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x - a$, the remainder is $f(a)$. In this case, we want to find the remainder when the polynomial is divided by $x^3 - x$, which can be factored as $x(x^2 - 1)$ or $(x-1)(x^2+x+1)$, but for the purpose of applying the Remainder Theorem directly, we'll consider the factorization $x(x-1)(x+1)$.\n## Step 3:  However, since we are dividing by $x^3-x$, we can simplify our approach by considering the roots of $x^3-x$, which are the solutions to $x^3-x=0$. This equation can be factored as $x(x^2-1)=0$, which gives us the roots $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$.\n## Step 4:  To find the remainder, we need to evaluate the polynomial at these roots because the remainder will be a polynomial of degree less than the divisor, which in this case is a cubic polynomial. Therefore, the remainder will be of the form $ax^2+bx+c$.\n## Step 5:  We evaluate the polynomial at each root: for $x=0$, the polynomial evaluates to $0^{18}+0^{13}+0^7+0^4+0=0$; for $x=1$, the polynomial evaluates to $1^{18}+1^{13}+1^7+1^4+1=5$; and for $x=-1$, the polynomial evaluates to $(-1)^{18}+(-1)^{13}+(-1)^7+(-1)^4+(-1)=-1+(-1)-1+1-1=-3$.\n## Step 6:  Since the remainder must be a polynomial of degree less than 3, we can use these three points to find the remainder polynomial. However, given the specific question, we are looking for a single numerical answer, which suggests we might be looking for a specific property or simplification of the remainder.\n## Step 7:  Considering the polynomial $x^{18}+x^{13}+x^7+x^4+x$ and the divisor $x^3-x$, we can observe that the polynomial can be written as a sum of terms that are multiples of $x^3-x$. This observation leads us to a simplification where we can express the polynomial as a sum of terms that are multiples of $x^3-x$, which will help us find the remainder.\n## Step 8:  We can express the polynomial as $x^{18}+x^{13}+x^7+x^4+x = (x^{18}-x^{15})+(x^{13}-x^{12})+(x^7-x^6)+(x^4-x^3)+x$. Each term in the sum is a multiple of $x^3-x$.\n## Step 9:  When we divide the polynomial by $x^3-x$, each of these terms will leave a remainder of 0, except for the last term $x$, which will leave a remainder of $x$.\n## Step 10:  However, we are looking for a single numerical answer, which suggests that we might be looking for a specific property or simplification of the remainder.

The possible times on a 12-hour digital clock are from `00` to `12`. Therefore, any number that can be formatted as `XX:YY` where `XX` is between `00` and `12`, and `YY` is between `00` and `59`, is good.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Bad Numbers\n\nA number is bad if it cannot be formatted as a valid time. This typically happens when:\n- The first two digits do not represent a valid hour (i.e., not between `00` and `12`).\n- The last two digits do not represent a valid minute (i.e., not between `00` and `59`).\n\n### Step 4: Finding Numbers Equivalent to 3 Modulo 4\n\nNumbers between 100 and 200 that are equivalent to 3 modulo 4 are those that satisfy \\(n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\). This means they can be expressed as \\(4k + 3\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n### Step 5: Checking the Range\n\nLet's check the range from 100 to 200:\n\n- The smallest number in this range equivalent to 3 modulo 4 is 103 (\\(4*25 + 3\\)).\n- The largest number in this range equivalent to 3 modulo 4 is 199 (\\(4*49 + 3\\)).\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Numbers\n\nTo count these numbers, notice the pattern:\n- Every fourth number starting from 103 is equivalent to 3 modulo 4 within our range.\n\nStarting from 103, the sequence would be: 103, 107, 111, ..., up to 199.\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Total\n\nThe formula to find the total number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is:\n\\[n = \\frac{{\\text{last term} - \\text{first term}}}{\\text{common difference}} + 1\\]\n\nHere, the common difference is 4 (since we're counting every fourth number), the first term is 103, and the last term is 199.\n\n\\[n = \\frac{199 - 103}{4} + 1 = \\frac{96}{4} + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, there are 25 bad integers between 100 and 200 that are equivalent to 3 modulo 4.

{"task_name": "math200", "generation": " the answer is 539. \nThis problem is a bit tricky, but we can break it down into smaller parts. First, we need to find the length of $DE$. We can do this by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side split by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. In this case, we have $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{5}{3}$. Let $BD = 5x$ and $DC = 3x$. Then, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $AD$. We have $AD^2 = AB^2 - BD^2 = 25 - 25x^2$. Now, we can use the fact that $DE$ is the diameter of circle $\\gamma$ to find its length. We have $DE = AD + CD = 8x$. Now, we can use the Power of a Point Theorem, which states that the product of the lengths of the segments from a point outside a circle to the two intersection points with the circle is equal to the square of the length of the segment from the point to the center of the circle. In this case, we have $AE \\cdot AF = AD^2$. We can substitute the values we found earlier to get $AE \\cdot AF = 25 - 25x^2$. Now, we can use the fact that $AE$ is the diameter of circle $\\omega$ to find its length. We have $AE = 7$. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation we found earlier to get $7 \\cdot AF = 25 - 25x^2$. We can solve for $AF$ to get $AF = \\frac{25 - 25x^2}{7}$. Now, we can use the fact that $x = \\frac{3}{8}$ to find the value of $AF$. We have $AF = \\frac{25 - 25 \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^2}{7} = \\frac{25 - \\frac{225}{64}}{7} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 64 - 225}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1600 - 225}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1375}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1375}{448}$. Now, we can square this value to get $AF^2 = \\frac{1375^2}{448^2} = \\frac{1890625}{1990656}$. Finally, we can add the numerator and denominator to get $m + n = 1890625 + 1990656 = 3881281$. However, we are asked to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction, so we need to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator and divide both by it.

Instead of dividing by 25, we should have factored out the 25 from the right side:\n\n\\[y^2 = \\frac{757}{25}\\]\n\nThis was incorrect. Let's correct this:\n\n\\[y^2 = \\frac{757}{25}\\]\n\nThis is not correct because we should have factored out the 25 correctly:\n\n\\[y^2 = \\frac{757}{25} = 30.28\\]\n\nThis is clearly not an integer, which contradicts our initial assumption that $x$ and $y$ are integers. Let's correct our approach:\n\nGiven:\n\\[y^2(1 + 3x^2) = 30x^2 + 517\\]\n\nSubstitute $x^2 = 8$:\n\\[y^2(1 + 3(8)) = 30(8) + 517\\]\n\\[y^2(1 + 24) = 240 + 517\\]\n\\[y^2(25) = 757\\]\n\nThis step was incorrect. Let's correct it:\n\n\\[y^2(25) = 757\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[y^2 = \\frac{757}{25}\\]\n\nThis is still incorrect. Let's re-examine the steps carefully:\n\nGiven:\n\\[y^2(1 + 3x^2) = 30x^2 + 517\\]\n\nSubstitute $x^2 = 8$:\n\\[y^2(1 + 3(8)) = 30(8) + 517\\]\n\\[y^2(1 + 24) = 2", "idx": 87, "selected_model": 2, "smoothie_weights": [0.11803510534568266, 0.21051637204545268, 0.352742005038585, 0.3187065175702795]}

We can do this by applying the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. \n\nFor triangle $ABC$, if $AB$ is the hypotenuse, then:\n\\[AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[10^2 = 6^2 + 8^2\\]\n\\[100 = 36 + 64\\]\n\\[100 = 100\\]\n\nSince the equation holds true, triangle $ABC$ is indeed a right triangle with the right angle at $C$. \n\nNext, we need to find the midpoint of $AB$.

Specifically, we aim to find a direct relation between $AF$ and $AT$ without explicitly calculating $FD$, $BT$, $EF$, or $CT$.\n\nRecall that the Angle Bisector Theorem gives us the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$ as $3:4$. This ratio also applies to the segments created by the angle bisector on the opposite side, implying that the entire segment $AT$ is divided in the same ratio by point $F$ when considering the entire length of $AB$ and $AC$.\n\nTherefore, if we consider the entire length of $AT$ as being divided in the ratio $3:4$ by point $F$, it implies that $F$ divides $AT$ in the same ratio as $AB$ to $AC$, which is $3:4$.\n\nThus, the fraction of $AF$ to $AT$ is directly related to the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$, which is $3:7$ (since $AB:AC = 3:4$ and considering the whole segment $AT$).\n\nHence,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{AF}{AT} = \\frac{3}{7}\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}\n\\]<|im_end|>", "idx": 101, "selected_model": 2, "smoothie_weights": [0.24323560983602502, 0.0534277459714783, 0.5085599171827667, 0.19477672700972992]}

{"task_name": "math200", "generation": " To find the range of the function \\(m(x) = \\sqrt{x + 5} + \\sqrt{20 - x}\\), we need to consider the domain and behavior of each square root term.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Domain\n\nFor \\(\\sqrt{x + 5}\\) to be defined, \\(x + 5 \\geq 0\\), which implies \\(x \\geq -5\\).\n\nFor \\(\\sqrt{20 - x}\\) to be defined, \\(20 - x \\geq 0\\), which implies \\(x \\leq 20\\).\n\nThus, the domain of \\(m(x)\\) is \\([-5, 20]\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Behavior\n\n#### Minimum Value:\nTo find the minimum value, consider the derivative or analyze the behavior directly. The function involves sums of square roots, which are generally increasing functions within their domains. However, since both terms are non-negative, the minimum occurs when both square roots are as small as possible within their respective constraints.\n\n- For \\(\\sqrt{x + 5}\\), the smallest value it can take is 0 (when \\(x = -5\\)).\n- For \\(\\sqrt{20 - x}\\), the smallest value it can take is also 0 (when \\(x = 20\\)).\n\nHowever, these conditions cannot be met simultaneously within the domain \\([-5, 20]\\). Instead, we look for the minimum value by considering the endpoints of the domain:\n\n- At \\(x = -5\\), \\(m(x) = \\sqrt{-5 + 5} + \\sqrt{20 - (-5)} = 0 + \\sqrt{25} = 5\\).\n- At \\(x = 20\\), \\(m(x) = \\sqrt{20 + 5} + \\sqrt{20 - 20} = \\sqrt{25} + 0 = 5\\).\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\(m(x)\\) within its domain is 5.\n\n#### Maximum Value:\nThe maximum value occurs when one of the square roots is maximized while the other is minimized, given the constraints of the domain. \n\n- Maximizing \\(\\sqrt{20 - x}\\) (which is maximized when \\(x\\) is minimized within the domain) gives \\(x = -5\\), leading to \\(m(x) = \\sqrt{-5 + 5} + \\sqrt{20 - (-5)} = 0 + \\sqrt{25} = 5\\).\n- Maximizing \\(\\sqrt{x + 5}\\) (which is maximized when \\(x\\) is maximized within the domain) gives \\(x = 20\\), leading to \\(m(x) = \\sqrt{20 + 5} + \\sqrt{20 - 20} = \\sqrt{25} + 0 = 5\\).\n\nHowever, this analysis doesn't directly give us the maximum value because the function's behavior suggests that the sum increases as \\(x\\) moves from -5 towards 20, due to the nature of square root functions. A more precise approach would involve calculus, but intuitively, the maximum value will occur near the midpoint of the domain where both terms contribute significantly to the sum.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Range\n\nGiven the behavior and constraints, the range of \\(m(x)\\) is determined by its minimum and maximum values within the domain \\([-5, 20]\\). Since the function increases monotonically within this interval, the range is from the minimum value found (5) to the maximum value, which is not directly calculable without further analysis but understood to increase with \\(x\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe range of the function \\(m(x) = \\sqrt{x + 5} + \\sqrt{20 - x}\\) over its domain \\([-5, 20]\\) is from 5 to infinity. However, since the question asks for a single numerical number representing the range, and considering the context provided, the focus was on understanding the behavior rather than providing a strict numerical range endpoint. Thus, the essence of the range is best described conceptually rather than numerically confined to a single value.\n\n**Answer**: The range of \\(m(x)\\) is conceptually understood to start at 5 and extend to positive infinity, reflecting the continuous increase of the function within its domain. However, for the format requested, the emphasis should be on the method of determining the range rather than providing a single numerical endpoint.<|im_end|>", "idx": 144, "selected_model": 2, "smoothie_weights": [0.07497050065950485, 0.048631511254612, 0.7626033451845733, 0.11379464290130992]}

Specifically, the operations imply that $x$ must be chosen such that the adjustments made by the operations on both sides of the equation lead to equivalent outcomes.\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Solution\n\nUpon closer inspection and considering the properties of the floor function and the operations involved, we realize that the solution hinges on the relationship between $x$ and its multiples, particularly focusing on how the operations affect the integer parts and their alignment.\n\n**Solution**:\n\nAfter analyzing the conditions under which the operations on both sides of the equation yield equivalent results, we find that the solution revolves around the specific intervals of $x$ that satisfy the equation based on the properties of the floor function and the operations applied.\n\n**Final Answer**: After detailed analysis, the solution to the equation involves identifying the intervals of $x$ that satisfy the given condition.

Through careful examination, one can deduce that the solution set for $x$ is determined by the specific intervals that ensure the equality holds true across the operations described.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for a simplified explanation, the exact numerical solution might not be straightforwardly provided without further context or specific steps tailored to the reader's level of understanding. However, the essence of solving such equations involves understanding the behavior of the floor function under various operations and identifying the intervals of $x$ that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**Note**: For a precise numerical answer, one would typically proceed with algebraic manipulation and consideration of the properties of the floor function, potentially leading to a set of inequalities that define the solution set for $x$.
