{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's first find the total number of stripes for all the zebras:\n\n1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, which is 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.\n2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes.\n3. Another zebra has half as many stripes as the third one, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.\n4. To find the total number of stripes, we add up the stripes from all the zebras: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.\n\nNow, to find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:\n\n1. There are 4 zebras in total (2 with 17 stripes, 1 with 36 stripes, and 1 with 18 stripes).\n2.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.\n4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many points Yuri scored:\n- Half of Naomi's points: \\( \\frac{68}{2} = 34 \\)\n- Yuri scored 10 more than this: \\( 34 + 10 = 44 \\)\n\nNext, we calculate how many points Brianna scored:\n- Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi: \\( 68 + 17 = 85 \\)\n\nNow, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:\n- Naomi: 68 points\n- Yuri: 44 points\n- Brianna: 85 points\n\nTo find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:\n\\[ 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jojo scored 54 points. The answer is 54.<|endoftext|>", "idx": 198, "selected_model": 3}
{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " First, let's calculate how far Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he was traveling at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he covered is:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\nDistance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours\nDistance = 30 miles\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it takes him to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We know that Distance = Speed × Time, so we can rearrange this formula to solve for Time:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nTime = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour\nTime = 5 hours\n\nSo, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back. The answer is {answer} is 5.<|im_end|>", "idx": 199, "selected_model": 2}
