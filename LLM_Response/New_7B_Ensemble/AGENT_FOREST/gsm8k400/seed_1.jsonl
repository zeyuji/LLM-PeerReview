Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \\frac{\\text{Jamal's phone capacity}}{6} \\]\n\nGiven that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we substitute this value into our equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \\frac{1800}{6} = 300 \\]\n\nSo, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.\n\nNext, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can set up another equation to find out how many birds are in Jamal's photograph:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of birds in Jamal's photograph} = \\frac{\\text{Brittany's phone capacity}}{50} \\]\n\nSubstituting the value for Brittany's phone capacity:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of birds in Jamal's photograph} = \\frac{300}{50} = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. \n\nThe answer is {6}.<|im_end|>", "idx": 15, "selected_model": 2, "bleu_scores": [37.235344677139906, 19.195689476845907, 63.06483519750782, 52.932583500523535]}

Her average speed for the first part of the hike is given as 4 miles per hour.\n3. To find her speed for the remaining part of the hike, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the remaining 6 miles and then calculate her speed based on that time.\n4. Since she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, she has 6 miles left to walk in the remaining time.\n5. Let x be the time (in hours) it takes her to walk the remaining 6 miles.\n6. Her total time for the hike will be 2 hours + x hours.\n7. The total distance she needs to cover is 12 miles, so the distance she has already covered is 6 miles, and the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.\n8. Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can write an equation for the remaining part of the hike: 6 = (Remaining Speed) * x.\n9. We know that her average speed for the entire hike is 4 miles per hour, so the sum of her speed for the first part and the remaining part should equal 4 miles per hour: (4 miles/hour) + (Remaining Speed) = 4 miles/hour.\n10. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:\n    - (4 miles/hour) + (Remaining Speed) = 4 miles/hour\n    - 6 = (Remaining Speed) * x\n11. Dividing the first equation by 4, we get: 1 + (Remaining Speed/4) = 1.\n12. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get: (Remaining Speed/4) = 0.\n13. Multiplying both sides by 4, we get: Remaining Speed = 0 miles/hour.\n14. However, this solution is not possible because a speed of 0 miles per hour means she is not moving.\n15. Since the problem states that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, it means that she must maintain a constant speed of 4 miles per hour throughout the entire hike.\n16.
