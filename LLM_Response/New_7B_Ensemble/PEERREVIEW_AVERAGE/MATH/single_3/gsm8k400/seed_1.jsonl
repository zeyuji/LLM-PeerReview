It's stated that candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate this as:\n\nVotes for B = Votes for A + (50% of Votes for A) = 20 + (0.50 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes\n\nNow, we know that the total votes are 100. To find out how many votes candidate C got, we subtract the votes for A and B from the total votes:\n\nVotes for C = Total votes - (Votes for A + Votes for B) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes\n\nSo, candidate C received 50 votes.

Your final answer should be a single numerical number, in the form 'the answer is {answer}', at the end of your response.\n## Step 1: Convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches\nFirst, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Then, we add the 4 inches to get a total of 100 inches for the length of Topher's shoe.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information\nWe are told that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
