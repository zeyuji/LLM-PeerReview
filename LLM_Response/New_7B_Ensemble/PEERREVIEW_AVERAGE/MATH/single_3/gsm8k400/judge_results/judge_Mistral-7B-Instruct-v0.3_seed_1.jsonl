Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, and we know that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fewer fruits than this, we can calculate the number of fruits an 8-year-old tree produces as follows:\n\n1000 fruits (from a 10-year-old tree) - 200 fruits = 800 fruits (from an 8-year-old tree).\n\nNow, let's add up all the fruits produced by the avocado tree over its 10 years of life:\n\n- 5-year-old: 50 fruits\n- 6-year-old: 150 fruits\n- 7-year-old: 350 fruits\n- 8-year-old: 800 fruits\n- 9-year-old: 0 fruits\n- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits\n\nTotal fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the avocado tree can produce a total of 2350 fruits during its 10 years of life.<|im_end|>", "idx": 55, "selected_model": 2}

{"task_name": "gsm8k400", "generation": " is 4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws used.  The answer is 8. \nThe answer is 8. \n\nExplanation: \nTo find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to first calculate how many screws he will use in total.  We know that each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, so we can multiply the number of legs by the number of screws per leg to get the total number of screws used per table.  This is 4 legs x 2 screws = 8 screws per table.  Since James is putting together 4 tables, we can multiply the number of screws used per table by the number of tables to get the total number of screws used.  This is 8 screws per table x 4 tables = 32 screws used.  To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has.  This is 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over.  Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over. \n\nNote: The problem statement is a bit confusing, as it says '4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws used', which is not a correct mathematical operation.  The correct operation is 4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws per 4 tables, not 32 screws used.  However, the problem statement is still solvable, and the correct answer is 8 screws left over. \n\nThis problem is a good example of how to use multiplication to solve a real-world problem, and how to subtract to find the leftover amount.

Given the information provided, the most straightforward interpretation is that Morgan plans to spend the remaining budget on each friend equally, leading to:\n\nNumber of friends = $60 / $5 = 12\n\nTherefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her birthday party under the given conditions. \n\nThe answer is {12}.<|im_end|>", "idx": 157, "selected_model": 2}

Her average speed for the first part of the hike is given as 4 miles per hour.\n3. To find her speed for the remaining part of the hike, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the remaining 6 miles and then calculate her speed based on that time.\n4. Since she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, she has 6 miles left to walk in the remaining time.\n5. Let x be the time (in hours) it takes her to walk the remaining 6 miles.\n6. Her total time for the hike will be 2 hours + x hours.\n7. The total distance she needs to cover is 12 miles, so the distance she has already covered is 6 miles, and the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.\n8. Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can write an equation for the remaining part of the hike: 6 = (Remaining Speed) * x.\n9. We know that her average speed for the entire hike is 4 miles per hour, so the sum of her speed for the first part and the remaining part should equal 4 miles per hour: (4 miles/hour) + (Remaining Speed) = 4 miles/hour.\n10. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:\n    - (4 miles/hour) + (Remaining Speed) = 4 miles/hour\n    - 6 = (Remaining Speed) * x\n11.
