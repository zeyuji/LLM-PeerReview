Therefore, $11! + 8$ will also be divisible by any divisor of $10!$ because adding 8 to a multiple of $10!$ does not change its divisibility by any divisor of $10!$.\n\nHowever, when considering $10! + 2$, we see that this expression is not divisible by any number greater than 2 that would also divide $10!$ (since $10!$ is divisible by all numbers up to 10, but adding 2 makes it odd and thus not divisible by even numbers greater than 2).\n\nGiven this, the only common divisor between $10! + 2$ and $11! + 8$ must be a divisor of both $10!$ and $2$. Since $10!$ is divisible by 2 (as it includes the multiplication of all numbers up to 10), the greatest common divisor of $10! + 2$ and $11! + 8$ is **2**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **the answer is 2**.<|im_end|>", "idx": 21, "selected_model": 2}

{"task_name": "math200", "generation": " the answer is 539. \nThis problem is a bit tricky, but we can break it down into smaller parts. First, we need to find the length of $DE$. We can do this by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side split by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. In this case, we have $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{5}{3}$. Let $BD = 5x$ and $DC = 3x$. Then, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $AD$. We have $AD^2 = AB^2 - BD^2 = 25 - 25x^2$. Now, we can use the fact that $DE$ is the diameter of circle $\\gamma$ to find its length. We have $DE = AD + CD = 8x$. Now, we can use the Power of a Point Theorem, which states that the product of the lengths of the segments from a point outside a circle to the two intersection points with the circle is equal to the square of the length of the segment from the point to the center of the circle. In this case, we have $AE \\cdot AF = AD^2$. We can substitute the values we found earlier to get $AE \\cdot AF = 25 - 25x^2$. Now, we can use the fact that $AE$ is the diameter of circle $\\omega$ to find its length. We have $AE = 7$. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation we found earlier to get $7 \\cdot AF = 25 - 25x^2$. We can solve for $AF$ to get $AF = \\frac{25 - 25x^2}{7}$. Now, we can use the fact that $x = \\frac{3}{8}$ to find the value of $AF$. We have $AF = \\frac{25 - 25 \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^2}{7} = \\frac{25 - \\frac{225}{64}}{7} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 64 - 225}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1600 - 225}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1375}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1375}{448}$. Now, we can square this value to get $AF^2 = \\frac{1375^2}{448^2} = \\frac{1890625}{1990656}$. Finally, we can add the numerator and denominator to get $m + n = 1890625 + 1990656 = 3881281$. However, we are asked to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction, so we need to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator and divide both by it.

Calculate the length of $BC$: Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of $BC$ as $\\sqrt{(5-0)^2+(0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.\n4. Calculate the length of $DC$: Since $EC = 4$, and $EC$ is equal to the difference between $BC$ and $CD$, we have $CD = BC - EC = 5 - 4 = 1$. Therefore, $DC = CD + C - A = 1 + 5 - A$. Since $A$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $A$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the way from $B$ to $C$, so $A = \\frac{1}{2}(5) = 2.5$. Therefore, $DC = 1 + 5 - 2.5 = 3.5$.\n5.

Since $a, b, c, d$ are nonnegative real numbers and their sum is 1, we can think of them as the probabilities of four mutually exclusive events.\n\n2. Let's consider the events $A, B, C, D$ corresponding to $a, b, c, d$ respectively. The probability of at least two of these events occurring is given by the sum of probabilities of the following three cases:\n   - $A \\cap B \\cap C \\cap D$ (all four events occur)\n   - $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C) \\cup (A \\cap D) \\cup (B \\cap C) \\cup (B \\cap D) \\cup (C \\cap D)$ (exactly three events occur)\n   - $(A \\cup B) \\cup (A \\cup C) \\cup (A \\cup D) \\cup (B \\cup C) \\cup (B \\cup D) \\cup (C \\cup D)$ (at least two events occur)\n\n3. The probability of all four events occurring is $a^4$. The probability of exactly three events occurring is $3 \\cdot (a^3 \\cdot (1-a))$. The probability of at least two events occurring is the sum of these two probabilities.\n\n4. We want to maximize the sum $ab + bc + cd$, which is equal to the probability of at least two events occurring minus the probability of all four events occurring. So, we need to find the maximum value of $3 \\cdot (a^3 \\cdot (1-a)) - a^4$.\n\n5. Differentiating the expression with respect to $a$ and setting it equal to zero, we get $3 \\cdot (3a^2 - 1) - 4a^3 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation, we find that $a = \\frac{1}{4}$ is a solution.\n\n6. To check if this is a maximum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative is $12a - 12a^2 - 12$, which is negative for $a > \\frac{1}{3}$ and positive for $a < \\frac{1}{3}$. Since $a > 0$, the maximum occurs at $a = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n7.

For example, $\\lfloor 3.1 \\rfloor = 3$ and $\\lfloor -2.9 \\rfloor = -3$.\n\n2. Now, let's look at the given equation: $\\lfloor \\lfloor 2x \\rfloor - 1/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor.$\n\n3. Inside the outermost floor function, we have $2x$. Since the floor function rounds down, this means that the largest integer less than or equal to $2x$ is used. Let's call this integer $n$. So, $n \\leq 2x < n + 1$.\n\n4. The next step is to subtract $1/2$ from $n$. Since $n$ is an integer, subtracting $1/2$ will not change the integer part of $n$. However, it will change the fractional part. If the fractional part of $n$ was greater than or equal to $1/2$, then subtracting $1/2$ will make it less than $1/2$, and the integer part will decrease by $1$. If the fractional part of $n$ was less than $1/2$, then subtracting $1/2$ will make it less than $1/2$, but the integer part will remain the same. Let's call the result of this operation $m$. So, $m = n - 1/2$.\n\n5. Now, we have $\\lfloor m \\rfloor = \\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor$. Since the floor function rounds down, this means that the largest integer less than or equal to $m$ is used. Since $m$ is also an integer, this means that $\\lfloor m \\rfloor = m$.\n\n6. Now, we have $m = \\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor$. Since we know that $m = n - 1/2$, we can write the equation as $n - 1/2 = \\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor$.\n\n7. Since $n$ is an integer, we can write $n = \\lceil x + 2 + 1/2 \\rceil$, where $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$ is the ceiling function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.\n\n8. Now, we have $\\lceil x + 2 + 1/2 \\rceil = \\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor + 1$. This equation is equivalent to $\\lceil x + 3/2 \\rceil = \\lfloor x + 2 \\rfloor + 1$.\n\n9.

In this case, $x + 3/2 = (2k + 1) + 1 = 2k + 2$. However, this case is not possible because $x$ is supposed to be an integer.\n\n11.
