The prime factorization of 20 is $2^2 \\cdot 5$, and the prime factorization of 90 is $2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the greatest common factor (GCF)\nThe GCF is the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power they appear in either factorization. In this case, the common prime factors are 2 and 5. The smallest power of 2 is 1 (from 20) and the smallest power of 5 is 1 (from 20). Therefore, the GCF is $2^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM)\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved. In this case, the highest power of 2 is 2 (from 90), the highest power of 3 is 2 (from 90), and the highest power of 5 is 1 (from both 20 and 90).

Here, $\\theta$ is the central angle subtended by arc $AC$, which is $90^\\circ$ since it is a quarter-circle. The radius $r$ is $BC = \\frac{2}{\\pi}$.

The mistake in our reasoning is that we assumed that the shaded region $ABC$ would return to its original orientation when rolled along the board. In reality, the shaded region would rotate $180^\\circ$ around point $C$ when rolled along the board, so point $B$ would move along the board a distance equal to the diameter of the circle.\n\nThe diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diameter is $2 \\times BC = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{\\pi} = \\frac{4}{\\pi}$.

To solve this, we need to consider the different cases where the set *(n) has exactly three distinct elements. \n\nCase 1: n is even. In this case, the set *(n) will have exactly three distinct elements if n/2 is not equal to any of the other elements. This means that n/2 must not be equal to n-2, n+2, or 2n. We can rewrite these inequalities as: n/2 ≠ n-2, n/2 ≠ n+2, and n/2 ≠ 2n. Simplifying these inequalities, we get: n ≠ 4, n ≠ 0, and n ≠ 4. However, we already know that n is even, so n ≠ 0 is not a valid inequality. Therefore, the only valid inequality is n ≠ 4. This means that for n ≠ 4, the set *(n) will have exactly three distinct elements when n is even.\n\nCase 2: n is odd. In this case, the set *(n) will have exactly three distinct elements if n/2 is not equal to any of the other elements. This means that n/2 must not be equal to n-2, n+2, or 2n. We can rewrite these inequalities as: n/2 ≠ n-2, n/2 ≠ n+2, and n/2 ≠ 2n. Simplifying these inequalities, we get: n ≠ 3, n ≠ 1, and n ≠ 3. However, we already know that n is odd, so n ≠ 1 is not a valid inequality. Therefore, the only valid inequality is n ≠ 3. This means that for n ≠ 3, the set *(n) will have exactly three distinct elements when n is odd.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of distinct integers n that satisfy the conditions in both cases. For Case 1, we have n ≠ 4, and for Case 2, we have n ≠ 3. Since these are two separate cases, we need to find the number of distinct integers n that satisfy both conditions. However, there are no integers that satisfy both conditions, since n cannot be both even and odd. Therefore, the number of distinct integers n that satisfy the conditions in both cases is 0.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where n/2 is equal to one of the other elements. In this case, the set *(n) will have exactly three distinct elements if n/2 is equal to either n-2 or n+2. This means that n/2 = n-2 or n/2 = n+2. Solving these equations, we get: n = 4 or n = 0. However, we already know that n is even, so n = 0 is not a valid solution. Therefore, the only valid solution is n = 4. This means that for n = 4, the set *(n) will have exactly three distinct elements.\n\nWe also need to consider the case where n/2 is equal to 2n. In this case, the set *(n) will have exactly three distinct elements if n/2 = 2n. Solving this equation, we get: n = 0. However, we already know that n is even, so n = 0 is not a valid solution. Therefore, this case does not contribute any valid solutions.\n\nIn addition to the cases we have already considered, we also need to consider the case where n-2 is equal to one of the other elements. In this case, the set *(n) will have exactly three distinct elements if n-2 is equal to either n+2 or 2n. This means that n-2 = n+2 or n-2 = 2n. Solving these equations, we get: n = 4 or n = 2. However, we already know that n is even, so n = 2 is not a valid solution. Therefore, the only valid solution is n = 4.

In this case, the set *(n) will have exactly three distinct elements if n+2 is equal to either n-2 or 2n. This means that n+2 = n-2 or n+2 = 2n. Solving these equations, we get: n = 2 or n = 0.

The lines $y=k, \\qquad y=\\sqrt{3}x+2k, \\qquad y=-\\sqrt{3}x+2k,$ form a regular hexagon for each value of $k$. The area of the hexagon can be found by finding the area of the equilateral triangle formed by the lines $y=k, \\qquad y=\\sqrt{3}x+2k, \\qquad y=-\\sqrt{3}x+2k,$ and then multiplying it by $6$.

Solving for $x$, we get $40\\sqrt{3} - 2\\sqrt{3} = 12$, or $38\\sqrt{3} = 12$. Dividing both sides by $38$, we get $\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{12}{38} = \\frac{6}{19}$.

For card number 131 to retain its original position, we must have:\n\\[ k = 2(131 - n) \\]\nSince \\(k = 131\\), this implies:\n\\[ 131 = 2(131 - n) \\]\nSolving for \\(n\\):\n\\[ 131 = 262 - 2n \\]\n\\[ 2n = 131 \\]\n\\[ n = 131 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cards \\(2n\\) is:\n\\[ 2n = 2 \\times 131 = 262 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position is \\(\\boxed{262}\\).<|endoftext|>", "idx": 114, "selected_model": 3}

Instead, let's consider another approach using the AM-GM inequality.\n\n### Method 2: AM-GM Inequality\n\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), \\(\\frac{x + y}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{xy}\\), with equality if and only if \\(x = y\\).\n\nApplying AM-GM to each pair of terms:\n\n1.

When $0.42\\overline{153}$ is expressed as a fraction in the form $\\frac{x}{99900}$, what is the value of $x$? Explain your reasoning.

So, initially, we have:\n\n\\[5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\\]\n\nHowever, since the keychain can be rotated and flipped, we must account for these symmetries. For any linear arrangement, there are 5 possible rotations (one for each key), and each rotation is considered the same as another when placed on a keychain. Therefore, we divide by 5:\n\n\\[120 / 5 = 24\\]\n\nBut, we also need to consider reflections. Each arrangement can be flipped over, which means that each distinct arrangement has 2 duplicates (one for each orientation).

However, there's a more elegant way to approach this problem using the properties of the roots of polynomials and Vieta's formulas.\n\nGiven the polynomial\n\n\\[\nP(z) = z^{20} - 4z^{19} + 9z^{18} - 16z^{17} + \\dots + 441 = 0,\n\\]\n\nlet's denote its roots as $z_1, z_2, \\ldots, z_{20}$. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a polynomial $P(z) = z^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1z + a_0$ is equal to $-a_{n-1}$, and the product of the roots taken $k$ at a time is equal to $(-1)^k a_{n-k}$.\n\nIn our case, the sum of the roots is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{20} z_k = 4.\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the expression $\\cot \\left( \\sum_{k = 1}^{20} \\operatorname{arccot} z_k \\right)$. We know that $\\cot(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\tan(\\theta)}$, and $\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}$. However, a more direct approach involves recognizing that if $z_k$ are the roots of the polynomial, then $\\operatorname{arccot}(z_k)$ corresponds to the argument of each root in the complex plane.\n\nThe key insight here is to relate the sum of the arccotangents of the roots to the coefficients of the polynomial through the concept of the resultant or by considering the polynomial's behavior under transformations related to the cotangent function.\n\nFor a polynomial with roots $z_1, z_2, \\ldots, z_n$, the sum of the arccotangents of these roots can be related to the coefficients of the polynomial through the resultant of the polynomial and its derivative. Specifically, for a polynomial $P(z)$, the resultant of $P(z)$ and its derivative $P'(z)$ evaluated at $z = 1$ gives information about the sum of the arccotangents of the roots.\n\nHowever, without delving into the specifics of computing the resultant directly, we can leverage the symmetry and structure of the given polynomial to simplify our approach.\n\nGiven the pattern in the coefficients (which decrease quadratically), it suggests a relationship between the roots and their arccotangents that mirrors the structure of the polynomial itself. The key property here is that the sum of the arccotangents of the roots of a polynomial can often be related to the coefficients of the polynomial through specific identities or transformations.\n\nFor a polynomial of degree $n$, the sum of the arccotangents of its roots can be related to the coefficients through a series of identities involving the roots and their powers. In particular, for a polynomial like the one given, where the coefficients follow a specific pattern, the sum of the arccotangents of the roots can be shown to be related to the sum of the roots themselves, due to the nature of the transformation from roots to their arccotangents and back.\n\nGiven that the sum of the roots is $4$, and considering the symmetry and structure of the polynomial, we can deduce that the sum of the arccotangents of the roots simplifies to a value that reflects this property. Specifically, because the transformation from roots to arccotangents and back involves operations that preserve certain symmetries and relationships within the polynomial, the sum of the arccotangents of the roots will reflect the sum of the roots themselves, modulo some constant factor that arises from the nature of the cotangent function and its periodicity.\n\nThus, the sum of the arccotangents of the roots simplifies to $4$, and applying the cotangent function to this sum yields:\n\n\\[\n\\cot(4).\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\cot(4)}\n\\]<|im_end|>", "idx": 188, "selected_model": 2}

If \\(n = 2k\\) (even):\n   \\[ k-1 \\leq x < k-2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k \\leq x < k+\\frac{1}{2}. \\]\n   The intersection of these intervals is empty because \\(k-1 < k-2\\) and \\(k > k-2\\).\n\n2. If \\(n = 2k+1\\) (odd):\n   \\[ k-\\frac{1}{2} \\leq x < k+\\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2k-3 \\leq x < 2k-2. \\]\n   The intersection of these intervals is:\n   \\[ \\max\\left(k-\\frac{1}{2}, 2k-3\\right) \\leq x < \\min\\left(k+\\frac{1}{2}, 2k-2\\right). \\]\n   Simplifying the bounds:\n   \\[ 2k-3 \\leq x < 2k-2. \\]\n   Since \\(2k-3 < 2k-2\\), the interval is non-empty and valid.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\\[ 2k-3 \\leq x < 2k-2 \\quad \\text{for any integer } k. \\]\n\nTo find a specific numerical answer, we can choose \\(k = 0\\):\n\\[ -3 \\leq x < -2. \\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{-3}\\). However, since the problem asks for a single numerical answer and the interval \\([-3, -2)\\) is the general solution, we can box the lower bound as the representative answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-3}\n\\]<|endoftext|>", "idx": 199, "selected_model": 3}
