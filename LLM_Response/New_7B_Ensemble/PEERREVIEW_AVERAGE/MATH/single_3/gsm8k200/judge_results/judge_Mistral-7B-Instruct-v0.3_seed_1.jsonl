{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": "'the answer is 2.' \nLet's break down the information given in the problem. We know that there are four different colors of paint in the mural: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. This means that the amount of red paint is equal to the amount of white paint, and the amount of white paint is equal to the amount of purple paint. Let's call the amount of each of these three colors \"x\". \n\nWe also know that half the mural is yellow paint. This means that the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used, which is 12 pints. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12/2 = 6 pints.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of paint used. The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amount of red paint, white paint, purple paint, and yellow paint. We know that the amount of red paint is x, the amount of white paint is x, the amount of purple paint is x, and the amount of yellow paint is 6. So, the equation is:\n\nx + x + x + 6 = 12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x + 6 = 12\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n3x = 6\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 2\n\nSince x represents the amount of red paint, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints. \n\nthe answer is 2.  I hope it is correct.  I used the equation 3x + 6 = 12 to solve for x, which represents the amount of red paint.  I then divided both sides by 3 to isolate x, and found that x = 2.  Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.  I hope this is correct.  I am not sure if I did it correctly.  I hope someone can check my work.

So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is \\(x - 45\\%\\).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the charge remaining after an additional 3 hours of losing 7% of the total capacity each hour.\nAfter the first 5 hours, the power bank has \\(x - 45\\%\\) charge left.

{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": "\n\nHere's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, let's find out how much rice is consumed by the household in one meal. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice and there are 5 people, the total consumption for one meal is 5 * 0.2 = 1 kg.\n\n2. Since the household eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), the total daily consumption is 1 kg * 2 = 2 kg.\n\n3. To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total weight of the bag by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.\n\n4. To find out how many weeks this is, we divide the number of days by 7: 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.\n\nSo, the answer is: the answer is 3.</s>", "idx": 195, "selected_model": 1}

{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " First, let's calculate how much Carlos earns from selling lemons each year:\n\nHe gets 7 lemons per year, and each lemon sells for $1.5. So, his earnings from selling lemons each year are:\n\\[7 \\text{ lemons/year} \\times \\$1.5/\\text{lemon} = \\$10.5/\\text{year}\\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree each year from his earnings to find out how much he makes net profit each year:\n\\[\\$10.5/\\text{year} - \\$3/\\text{year} = \\$7.5/\\text{year}\\]\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) at this net profit rate of $7.5 per year.\n\nTo do this, divide the initial cost by the annual net profit:\n\\[\\frac{\\$90}{\\$7.5/\\text{year}} = 12 \\text{ years}\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree. \n\nThe answer is {12}.<|im_end|>", "idx": 197, "selected_model": 2}
