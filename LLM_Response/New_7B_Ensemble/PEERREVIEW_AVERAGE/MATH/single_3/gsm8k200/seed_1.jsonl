First, let's find out how much soil is used for each type of flower.\n   - Roses: 1 pound per rose\n   - Carnations: 1.5 pounds per carnation\n   - Sunflowers: 3 pounds per sunflower\n\n2. Next, let's calculate the total soil used for the given number of each flower type:\n   - Soil for carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds\n   - Soil for sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds\n   - Total soil used so far: 15 pounds (carnations) + 12 pounds (sunflowers) = 27 pounds\n\n3. Now, let's find out how much soil is left in the 30-pound bag:\n   - Total soil in the bag: 30 pounds\n   - Soil used so far: 27 pounds\n   - Soil left in the bag: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds\n\n4. Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:\n   - Roses: 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses\n\nSo, the answer is: the answer is 3. They can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.</s>", "idx": 24, "selected_model": 1}

Since the household eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), the total daily consumption is 1 kg * 2 = 2 kg.\n\n3.
