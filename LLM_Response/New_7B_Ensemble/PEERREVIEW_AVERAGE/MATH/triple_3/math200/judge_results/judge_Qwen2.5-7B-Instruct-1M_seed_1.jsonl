Therefore, the GCF is $2^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM)\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved. In this case, the highest power of 2 is 2 (from 90), the highest power of 3 is 2 (from 90), and the highest power of 5 is 1 (from both 20 and 90).

This phase ends when point $B$ has moved through an angle of $90^\\circ$.\n   - **Phase 2 (Linear movement)**: After completing the quarter-circle roll, point $B$ continues to move linearly until it returns to its original orientation.\n\n2. **Calculating Phase 1 distance**: Since $BC = \\frac{2}{\\pi}$ cm and $AC$ is a quarter-circle with center $B$, the radius of this quarter-circle is also $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ cm. The distance traveled by point $B$ during the quarter-circle roll is the circumference of a full circle divided by 4 (since only a quarter of the circle is rolled).

Since the arc $AC$ is quarter-circumference long, point $B$ will travel the same distance as the arc length, which we've already calculated as 1 cm, but in a straight line. However, since the question asks for the total path length that point $B$ travels, and considering the nature of the rolling motion, the linear movement essentially completes the path back to its original orientation without adding additional distance beyond the quarter-circle roll.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total path length that point $B$ travels is simply the distance covered during the quarter-circle roll, which is 1 cm.\n\nHence, the answer is **the length of the path that point B travels is 1 cm**.<|im_end|>", "idx": 4, "selected_model": 2}

Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length, we can express the perimeter as $2a + 2b = 40$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the sides.\n## Step 4:  We also know that the altitudes of a parallelogram are the perpendicular distances from a vertex to the opposite side. In this case, the altitudes are given as 4 and 7.\n## Step 5:  Using the given altitudes, we can form right-angled triangles within the parallelogram. Let's consider the right triangle formed by the altitude of length 4, the side of length $a$, and the side of length $b$.\n## Step 6:  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to this right triangle, we get $a^2 + 4^2 = b^2$, which simplifies to $a^2 + 16 = b^2$.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, for the right triangle formed by the altitude of length 7, the side of length $a$, and the side of length $b$, we have $a^2 + 7^2 = b^2$, which simplifies to $a^2 + 49 = b^2$.\n## Step 8:  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $33 = 2a^2$, which leads to $a^2 = \\frac{33}{2}$.\n## Step 9:  Substituting this value of $a^2$ into the equation $a^2 + 16 = b^2$, we find that $b^2 = \\frac{33}{2} + 16 = \\frac{65}{2}$.\n## Step 10:  Now, we can use the given information to find the value of $\\sin A$.

This is the region where the two lines y = x + 1/4 and y = x - 1/4 intersect.  The area of this region is 7/16, and the area of the entire square is 1.  Therefore, the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other is 7/16.  However, this is not the answer we are looking for.  We can find the answer we are looking for by subtracting the probability that they do not see each other from 1.  The probability that they do not see each other is 1 - 7/16 = 9/16.

{"task_name": "math200", "generation": " the answer is 660. \nThe answer is 660. \nThis problem is a bit tricky, but it can be solved by using the concept of a regular hexagon. The lines $y=k, \\qquad y=\\sqrt{3}x+2k, \\qquad y=-\\sqrt{3}x+2k,$ form a regular hexagon for each value of $k$. The area of the hexagon can be found by finding the area of the equilateral triangle formed by the lines $y=k, \\qquad y=\\sqrt{3}x+2k, \\qquad y=-\\sqrt{3}x+2k,$ and then multiplying it by $6$. The area of the equilateral triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\sin{60^{\\circ}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Therefore, the area of the hexagon is $6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3}$. The area of the regular hexagon can also be found by finding the area of the rectangle formed by the lines $y=k, \\qquad y=\\sqrt{3}x+2k, \\qquad y=-\\sqrt{3}x+2k,$ and then subtracting the areas of the two right triangles formed by the lines $y=k, \\qquad y=\\sqrt{3}x+2k, \\qquad y=-\\sqrt{3}x+2k,$ and the $x$-axis. The area of the rectangle is $20 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{3} = 40\\sqrt{3}$. The area of each right triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{3} = 6$. Therefore, the area of the regular hexagon is $40\\sqrt{3} - 2 \\cdot 6 = 40\\sqrt{3} - 12$. Since the area of the regular hexagon is $2\\sqrt{3}$, we have $40\\sqrt{3} - 12 = 2\\sqrt{3}$. Solving for $x$, we get $40\\sqrt{3} - 2\\sqrt{3} = 12$, or $38\\sqrt{3} = 12$. Dividing both sides by $38$, we get $\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{12}{38} = \\frac{6}{19}$. Squaring both sides, we get $3 = \\frac{36}{361}$. Multiplying both sides by $361$, we get $1083 = 36$. Dividing both sides by $36$, we get $30.083 = 1$. This is clearly not true, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back to the beginning and try a different approach. The lines $y=k, \\qquad y=\\sqrt{3}x+2k, \\qquad y=-\\sqrt{3}x+2k,$ form a regular hexagon for each value of $k$. The area of the hexagon can be found by finding the area of the equilateral triangle formed by the lines $y=k, \\qquad y=\\sqrt{3}x+2k, \\qquad y=-\\sqrt{3}x+2k,$ and then multiplying it by $6$.

{"task_name": "math200", "generation": " the answer is 539. \nThis problem is a bit tricky, but we can break it down into smaller parts. First, we need to find the length of $DE$. We can do this by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side split by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. In this case, we have $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{5}{3}$. Let $BD = 5x$ and $DC = 3x$. Then, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $AD$. We have $AD^2 = AB^2 - BD^2 = 25 - 25x^2$. Now, we can use the fact that $DE$ is the diameter of circle $\\gamma$ to find its length. We have $DE = AD + CD = 8x$. Now, we can use the Power of a Point Theorem, which states that the product of the lengths of the segments from a point outside a circle to the two intersection points with the circle is equal to the square of the length of the segment from the point to the center of the circle. In this case, we have $AE \\cdot AF = AD^2$. We can substitute the values we found earlier to get $AE \\cdot AF = 25 - 25x^2$. Now, we can use the fact that $AE$ is the diameter of circle $\\omega$ to find its length. We have $AE = 7$. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation we found earlier to get $7 \\cdot AF = 25 - 25x^2$. We can solve for $AF$ to get $AF = \\frac{25 - 25x^2}{7}$. Now, we can use the fact that $x = \\frac{3}{8}$ to find the value of $AF$. We have $AF = \\frac{25 - 25 \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^2}{7} = \\frac{25 - \\frac{225}{64}}{7} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 64 - 225}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1600 - 225}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1375}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1375}{448}$. Now, we can square this value to get $AF^2 = \\frac{1375^2}{448^2} = \\frac{1890625}{1990656}$. Finally, we can add the numerator and denominator to get $m + n = 1890625 + 1990656 = 3881281$. However, we are asked to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction, so we need to find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator and divide both by it. The greatest common divisor of 1890625 and 1990656 is 1, so we have $m + n = 1890625 + 1990656 = 3881281$.

Similarly, since Q(5)=152, we know that the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial multiplied by 5^n is 152. We can use these two equations to find the value of the polynomial at x=6.

We can try to find the correct answer by noticing that the coefficients of the polynomial are nonnegative integers.

However, this contradicts the fact that the roots are distinct.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, we must have $2a-1=0$, which gives us $a = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 8:  Substituting this value of $a$ into the equation $2a+b = -a$, we get $2(\\frac{1}{2})+b = -\\frac{1}{2}$, which simplifies to $1+b = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 9:  Solving for $b$, we find that $b = -\\frac{3}{2}$.\n## Step 10:  Finally, we can find the sum of $a$ and $b$ by adding $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\\frac{3}{2}$, which gives us $-\\frac{2}{2} = -1$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $-1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$\n\n## Step 12:  We can verify our solution by plugging in the values of $a$ and $b$ into the polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ and checking if the roots are indeed $2a$ and $b$.\n## Step 13:  Substituting $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = -\\frac{3}{2}$ into the polynomial, we get $p(x) = x^2+\\frac{1}{2}x-\\frac{3}{2}$.\n## Step 14:  Factoring the polynomial, we get $p(x) = (x-\\frac{3}{2})(x+\\frac{1}{2})$.\n## Step 15:  This shows that the roots of the polynomial are indeed $2a = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $b = -\\frac{1}{2}$, which confirms our solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$\n\n## Step 16:  We can also use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$.\n## Step 17:  The quadratic formula states that the roots of the polynomial $ax^2+bx+c$ are given by $x = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\n## Step 18:  In this case, the roots of the polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ are given by $x = \\frac{-a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-4b}}{2}$.\n## Step 19:  Since the roots are distinct, we know that $a^2-4b \\neq 0$.\n## Step 20:  Substituting $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = -\\frac{3}{2}$ into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-4(-\\frac{3}{2})}}{2}$.\n## Step 21:  Simplifying the expression, we get $x = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+6}}{2}$.\n## Step 22:  This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}+\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{4}}}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}-\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{4}}}{2}$", "idx": 78, "selected_model": 0}

For the third card: $38 + r = S$\n\nWhere $S$ represents the common sum on each card.\n\nFrom these equations, we can express $p$, $q$, and $r$ in terms of $S$:\n\n1. $p = S - 44$\n2. $q = S - 59$\n3. $r = S - 38$\n\nSince $p$, $q$, and $r$ are all prime numbers, we need to find values for $S$ that make each of these expressions prime.\n\nLet's start by finding possible values for $S$ that satisfy this condition. We know that $S$ must be greater than 59 because $q = S - 59$ would not yield a positive value otherwise. Also, $S$ must be greater than 44 because $p = S - 44$ would not yield a positive value otherwise.\n\nGiven that $S$ is the sum of a prime number and another number, let's consider the smallest primes greater than 59, which are 61, 67, 71, etc., and check if they can result in prime numbers when subtracted from them.\n\n- If $S = 61$, then:\n    - $p = 61 - 44 = 17$ (prime)\n    - $q = 61 - 59 = 2$ (prime)\n    - $r = 61 - 38 = 23$ (prime)\n\nThis satisfies our conditions, and since $S = 61$ results in all hidden numbers being prime, it is a valid solution.\n\nTo find the average of the hidden prime numbers, we simply add them together and divide by 3:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average} = \\frac{p + q + r}{3} = \\frac{17 + 2 + 23}{3} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the average of the hidden prime numbers is $\\boxed{14}$.<|im_end|>", "idx": 136, "selected_model": 2}

Since $a, b, c, d$ are nonnegative real numbers and their sum is 1, we can think of them as the probabilities of four mutually exclusive events.\n\n2. Let's consider the events $A, B, C, D$ corresponding to $a, b, c, d$ respectively. The probability of at least two of these events occurring is given by the sum of probabilities of the following three cases:\n   - $A \\cap B \\cap C \\cap D$ (all four events occur)\n   - $(A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C) \\cup (A \\cap D) \\cup (B \\cap C) \\cup (B \\cap D) \\cup (C \\cap D)$ (exactly three events occur)\n   - $(A \\cup B) \\cup (A \\cup C) \\cup (A \\cup D) \\cup (B \\cup C) \\cup (B \\cup D) \\cup (C \\cup D)$ (at least two events occur)\n\n3. The probability of all four events occurring is $a^4$. The probability of exactly three events occurring is $3 \\cdot (a^3 \\cdot (1-a))$. The probability of at least two events occurring is the sum of these two probabilities.\n\n4. We want to maximize the sum $ab + bc + cd$, which is equal to the probability of at least two events occurring minus the probability of all four events occurring. So, we need to find the maximum value of $3 \\cdot (a^3 \\cdot (1-a)) - a^4$.\n\n5. Differentiating the expression with respect to $a$ and setting it equal to zero, we get $3 \\cdot (3a^2 - 1) - 4a^3 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation, we find that $a = \\frac{1}{4}$ is a solution.\n\n6. To check if this is a maximum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative is $12a - 12a^2 - 12$, which is negative for $a > \\frac{1}{3}$ and positive for $a < \\frac{1}{3}$. Since $a > 0$, the maximum occurs at $a = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n7.

{"task_name": "math200", "generation": " the answer is 19. \nThe problem asks for the number of lattice points that are on the boundary or inside the region bounded by the equations $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2+6$. To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection points of the two equations and then count the lattice points within the enclosed region.\n\n## Step 1: Find the intersection points of the two equations\nTo find the intersection points, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. We have $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2+6$. Setting them equal, we get $|x|=-x^2+6$. We need to consider two cases: when $x\\geq 0$ and when $x<0$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for x when $x\\geq 0$\nWhen $x\\geq 0$, we have $x=-x^2+6$. Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2+x-6=0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x+3)(x-2)=0$. Solving for x, we get $x=-3$ or $x=2$. However, since we are considering the case when $x\\geq 0$, we discard the solution $x=-3$. Therefore, the only intersection point in this case is $x=2$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for x when $x<0$\nWhen $x<0$, we have $-x=-x^2+6$. Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2-x-6=0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x-3)(x+2)=0$. Solving for x, we get $x=3$ or $x=-2$. However, since we are considering the case when $x<0$, we discard the solution $x=3$. Therefore, the only intersection point in this case is $x=-2$.\n\n## Step 4: Count the lattice points within the enclosed region\nNow that we have found the intersection points, we can count the lattice points within the enclosed region. We need to consider the x-values from -2 to 2, inclusive. For each x-value, we need to find the corresponding y-values that satisfy both equations.\n\n## Step 5: Count the lattice points for each x-value\nWhen $x=-2$, the only lattice point is $(-2,2)$. When $x=-1$, the lattice points are $(-1,1)$ and $(-1,5)$. When $x=0$, the lattice points are $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,6)$. When $x=1$, the lattice points are $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$. When $x=2$, the only lattice point is $(2,2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Count the total number of lattice points\nAdding up the lattice points from each x-value, we get a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9 lattice points on the boundary. However, we need to include the lattice points inside the region. We can see that there are 10 additional lattice points inside the region.\n\n## Step 7: Add the lattice points on the boundary and inside the region\nAdding the lattice points on the boundary and inside the region, we get a total of 9 + 10 = 19 lattice points.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$\n\nThis problem can be solved by finding the intersection points of the two equations and then counting the lattice points within the enclosed region. The intersection points are $x=-2$ and $x=2$. The lattice points within the enclosed region are counted for each x-value from -2 to 2, inclusive.

The problem can be solved by using the formula for the area of a regular hexagon, which is given by A = (3*sqrt(3)/2)*s^2, where s is the length of a side of the hexagon.

The area of each triangle is given by (1/2)*b*h, where b is the length of the base (which is a side of the hexagon) and h is the height (which is the length of the perpendicular). Since the hexagon is regular, the six triangles are congruent, and we can find the area of one triangle and multiply it by 6 to get the total area of the hexagon.
