However, since \\(\\arccos\\) only outputs values between 0 and \\(\\pi\\), we are interested in how \\(\\sin x\\) maps into this range.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Function's Behavior\n\nConsider the properties of \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\arccos\\):\n- For \\(0 \\le x \\le \\pi\\), \\(\\sin x\\) increases from 0 to 1, so \\(\\arccos(\\sin x)\\) decreases from \\(\\pi/2\\) to 0.\n- For \\(\\pi \\le x \\le 2\\pi\\), \\(\\sin x\\) decreases from 1 back to 0, so \\(\\arccos(\\sin x)\\) increases from 0 to \\(\\pi/2\\).\n- This pattern repeats every \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Function Over the Given Interval\n\nGiven the interval \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\), we can see it spans one full cycle of the pattern described above plus an additional half-cycle.\n\n#### Within \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\):\n- The function behaves as described above, forming a triangle with base \\(\\pi\\) and height \\(\\pi/2\\).\n\n#### From \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\):\n- This is another half-cycle, mirroring the behavior from \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) to \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), thus forming another triangle with the same dimensions.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Area\n\nEach triangle has a base of \\(\\pi\\) and a height of \\(\\pi/2\\). The area of a triangle is given by:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\]\n\nThus, the area of one triangle is:\n\\[A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\pi \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\]\n\nSince there are two such triangles (one for each half-cycle within the given interval), the total area is:\n\\[A_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times A_{\\text{triangle}} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe area bounded by the graph of \\(y = \\arccos(\\sin x)\\) and the \\(x\\)-axis on the interval \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}}\n\\]<|im_end|>", "idx": 12, "selected_model": 2}

Therefore, $11! + 8$ will also be divisible by any divisor of $10!$ because adding 8 to a multiple of $10!$ does not change its divisibility by any divisor of $10!$.\n\nHowever, when considering $10! + 2$, we see that this expression is not divisible by any number greater than 2 that would also divide $10!$ (since $10!$ is divisible by all numbers up to 10, but adding 2 makes it odd and thus not divisible by even numbers greater than 2).\n\nGiven this, the only common divisor between $10! + 2$ and $11! + 8$ must be a divisor of both $10!$ and $2$. Since $10!$ is divisible by 2 (as it includes the multiplication of all numbers up to 10), the greatest common divisor of $10! + 2$ and $11! + 8$ is **2**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **the answer is 2**.<|im_end|>", "idx": 21, "selected_model": 2}

Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length, we can express the perimeter as $2a + 2b = 40$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the sides.\n## Step 4:  We also know that the altitudes of a parallelogram are the perpendicular distances from a vertex to the opposite side. In this case, the altitudes are given as 4 and 7.\n## Step 5:  Using the given altitudes, we can form right-angled triangles within the parallelogram. Let's consider the right triangle formed by the altitude of length 4, the side of length $a$, and the side of length $b$.\n## Step 6:  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to this right triangle, we get $a^2 + 4^2 = b^2$, which simplifies to $a^2 + 16 = b^2$.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, for the right triangle formed by the altitude of length 7, the side of length $a$, and the side of length $b$, we have $a^2 + 7^2 = b^2$, which simplifies to $a^2 + 49 = b^2$.\n## Step 8:  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $33 = 2a^2$, which leads to $a^2 = \\frac{33}{2}$.\n## Step 9:  Substituting this value of $a^2$ into the equation $a^2 + 16 = b^2$, we find that $b^2 = \\frac{33}{2} + 16 = \\frac{65}{2}$.\n## Step 10:  Now, we can use the given information to find the value of $\\sin A$.

Therefore, the answer is $-1.20. the answer is $-1.20.  Explanation:  To find the expected winnings from one flip, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding winnings and then add up the results.  The probability of the coin landing on heads is $\\frac35$, and the winnings for this outcome are 4 dollars.  So the contribution of this outcome to the expected winnings is $\\frac35\\cdot 4 = \\frac{12}{5}$ dollars.  The probability of the coin landing on tails is $\\frac15$, and the winnings for this outcome are -1 dollar.  So the contribution of this outcome to the expected winnings is $\\frac15\\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{1}{5}$ dollars.  The probability of the coin landing on its edge is $\\frac15$, and the winnings for this outcome are -10 dollars.  So the contribution of this outcome to the expected winnings is $\\frac15\\cdot (-10) = -2$ dollars.  Adding up the contributions of all three outcomes, we get $\\frac{12}{5} - \\frac{1}{5} - 2 = \\frac{11}{5} - 2 = \\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{10}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$.

We need to calculate P(X=4), P(X=5), P(X=6), and P(X=7) and then sum these probabilities.\n## Step 6:  P(X=4) = (7 choose 4) * (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^3 = 35 * (1/16) * (1/8) = 35/128.\n## Step 7:  P(X=5) = (7 choose 5) * (1/2)^5 * (1/2)^2 = 21 * (1/32) * (1/4) = 21/128.\n## Step 8:  P(X=6) = (7 choose 6) * (1/2)^6 * (1/2)^1 = 7 * (1/64) * (1/2) = 7/256.\n## Step 9:  P(X=7) = (7 choose 7) * (1/2)^7 * (1/2)^0 = 1 * (1/128) * 1 = 1/128.\n## Step 10:  Now, we sum these probabilities: P(at least 4 wins) = P(X=4) + P(X=5) + P(X=6) + P(X=7) = 35/128 + 21/128 + 7/256 + 1/128.\n## Step 11:  To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 256.

{"task_name": "math200", "generation": " the answer is 539. \nThis problem is a bit tricky, but we can break it down into smaller parts. First, we need to find the length of $DE$. We can do this by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side split by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. In this case, we have $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{5}{3}$. Let $BD = 5x$ and $DC = 3x$. Then, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $AD$. We have $AD^2 = AB^2 - BD^2 = 25 - 25x^2$. Now, we can use the fact that $DE$ is the diameter of circle $\\gamma$ to find its length. We have $DE = AD + CD = 8x$. Now, we can use the Power of a Point Theorem, which states that the product of the lengths of the segments from a point outside a circle to the two intersection points with the circle is equal to the square of the length of the segment from the point to the center of the circle. In this case, we have $AE \\cdot AF = AD^2$. We can substitute the values we found earlier to get $AE \\cdot AF = 25 - 25x^2$. Now, we can use the fact that $AE$ is the diameter of circle $\\omega$ to find its length. We have $AE = 7$. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation we found earlier to get $7 \\cdot AF = 25 - 25x^2$. We can solve for $AF$ to get $AF = \\frac{25 - 25x^2}{7}$. Now, we can use the fact that $x = \\frac{3}{8}$ to find the value of $AF$. We have $AF = \\frac{25 - 25 \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^2}{7} = \\frac{25 - \\frac{225}{64}}{7} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 64 - 225}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1600 - 225}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1375}{7 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{1375}{448}$. Now, we can square this value to get $AF^2 = \\frac{1375^2}{448^2} = \\frac{1890625}{1990656}$. Finally, we can add the numerator and denominator to get $m + n = 1890625 + 1990656 = 3881281$.

If a polynomial has real coefficients, then any complex zeros it has must come in conjugate pairs.\n## Step 4:  This means that if $a + bi$ is a zero of the polynomial, then $a - bi$ must also be a zero of the polynomial.\n## Step 5:  We are given that the polynomial has two real zeros, both of which are integers.

However, this calculation doesn't directly give us the probability that there is at least one card between the jokers at position \\(i\\), because it doesn't account for the fact that we need to ensure there's no joker at position \\(i\\) and also that there's at least one non-joker card between the jokers.\n\nA more straightforward approach is to realize that for any given position \\(i\\), the probability that there is at least one card between the two jokers is simply the probability that the first joker is before \\(i\\) and the second joker is after \\(i\\), or vice versa. This happens with a probability of \\(\\frac{52}{54} \\times \\frac{53}{53} = \\frac{52}{54}\\), because once the first joker is placed, there are 53 remaining positions for the second joker out of 54 total positions.\n\nSince there are 54 positions, and each position has an independent probability of \\(\\frac{52}{54}\\) of having at least one card between the two jokers, by the linearity of expectation, the expected number of positions with at least one card between the two jokers is:\n\n\\[E = 54 \\times \\frac{52}{54} = 52.\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of cards that will be strictly between the two jokers is \\(52\\). So, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{the answer is } 52.\n\\]<|im_end|>", "idx": 109, "selected_model": 2}

The distance from the circumcenter to any vertex of the triangle is equal to the circumradius R.\n\nGiven that the equation holds true for all three sides of the triangle, it implies that point P is indeed the circumcenter of triangle ABC. \n\nThe key insight here is recognizing that the given condition essentially states that the sum of the squares of the distances from point P to two vertices plus the square of the distance to one side equals the sum of the squares of the distances to another pair of vertices plus the square of the distance to the remaining side. This equality only holds when P is the circumcenter, as the distances from the circumcenter to the vertices are equal (all being R).\n\nTherefore, the common value we're looking for is simply the square of the circumradius R, because the equation essentially describes the relationship between the sides of the triangle and its circumradius when P is the circumcenter.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\\[R^2\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[the\\ answer\\ is\\ R^2\\]<|im_end|>", "idx": 129, "selected_model": 2}

To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection points of the two equations and then count the lattice points within the enclosed region.\n\n## Step 1: Find the intersection points of the two equations\nTo find the intersection points, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. We have $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2+6$. Setting them equal, we get $|x|=-x^2+6$. We need to consider two cases: when $x\\geq 0$ and when $x<0$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for x when $x\\geq 0$\nWhen $x\\geq 0$, we have $x=-x^2+6$. Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2+x-6=0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x+3)(x-2)=0$. Solving for x, we get $x=-3$ or $x=2$. However, since we are considering the case when $x\\geq 0$, we discard the solution $x=-3$. Therefore, the only intersection point in this case is $x=2$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for x when $x<0$\nWhen $x<0$, we have $-x=-x^2+6$. Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2-x-6=0$. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x-3)(x+2)=0$. Solving for x, we get $x=3$ or $x=-2$. However, since we are considering the case when $x<0$, we discard the solution $x=3$. Therefore, the only intersection point in this case is $x=-2$.\n\n## Step 4: Count the lattice points within the enclosed region\nNow that we have found the intersection points, we can count the lattice points within the enclosed region. We need to consider the x-values from -2 to 2, inclusive. For each x-value, we need to find the corresponding y-values that satisfy both equations.\n\n## Step 5: Count the lattice points for each x-value\nWhen $x=-2$, the only lattice point is $(-2,2)$. When $x=-1$, the lattice points are $(-1,1)$ and $(-1,5)$. When $x=0$, the lattice points are $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,6)$. When $x=1$, the lattice points are $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$. When $x=2$, the only lattice point is $(2,2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Count the total number of lattice points\nAdding up the lattice points from each x-value, we get a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9 lattice points on the boundary.
