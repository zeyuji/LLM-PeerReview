{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " is 4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws used.  The answer is 8. \nThe answer is 8. \n\nExplanation: \nTo find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to first calculate how many screws he will use in total.  We know that each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, so we can multiply the number of legs by the number of screws per leg to get the total number of screws used per table.  This is 4 legs x 2 screws = 8 screws per table.  Since James is putting together 4 tables, we can multiply the number of screws used per table by the number of tables to get the total number of screws used.  This is 8 screws per table x 4 tables = 32 screws used.  To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has.  This is 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over.  Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over. \n\nNote: The problem statement is a bit confusing, as it says '4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws used', which is not a correct mathematical operation.  The correct operation is 4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws per 4 tables, not 32 screws used.  However, the problem statement is still solvable, and the correct answer is 8 screws left over. \n\nThis problem is a good example of how to use multiplication to solve a real-world problem, and how to subtract to find the leftover amount.

Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, the time spent on the beach can be calculated as 2/x.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the time spent on the beach\nWe are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. So, we can set up the equation 2/x = 40/60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for x\nSimplifying the equation, we get 2/x = 2/3. Cross-multiplying, we get 2*3 = 2x, which simplifies to 6 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 3 miles per minute.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the speed of Grandma on the sidewalk\nSince Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2*3 = 6 miles per minute.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk\nThe distance walked on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and the speed is 6 miles per minute. So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1/6 minutes.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total time spent walking\nThe total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.
