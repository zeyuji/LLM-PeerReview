{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": "\n\nTo solve this problem, let's first find the total number of stripes for all the zebras:\n\n1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, which is 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.\n2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes.\n3. Another zebra has half as many stripes as the third one, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.\n4. To find the total number of stripes, we add up the stripes from all the zebras: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.\n\nNow, to find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:\n\n1. There are 4 zebras in total (2 with 17 stripes, 1 with 36 stripes, and 1 with 18 stripes).\n2. So, the average number of stripes per zebra is 88 / 4 = 22 stripes.\n\nThe answer is: the average number of stripes per zebra is 22.</s>", "idx": 0, "selected_model": 1}
{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": "'the answer is 2.' \nLet's break down the information given in the problem. We know that there are four different colors of paint in the mural: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. This means that the amount of red paint is equal to the amount of white paint, and the amount of white paint is equal to the amount of purple paint. Let's call the amount of each of these three colors \"x\". \n\nWe also know that half the mural is yellow paint. This means that the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used, which is 12 pints. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12/2 = 6 pints.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of paint used. The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amount of red paint, white paint, purple paint, and yellow paint. We know that the amount of red paint is x, the amount of white paint is x, the amount of purple paint is x, and the amount of yellow paint is 6. So, the equation is:\n\nx + x + x + 6 = 12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x + 6 = 12\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n3x = 6\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 2\n\nSince x represents the amount of red paint, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints. \n\nthe answer is 2.  I hope it is correct.  I used the equation 3x + 6 = 12 to solve for x, which represents the amount of red paint.  I then divided both sides by 3 to isolate x, and found that x = 2.  Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.  I hope this is correct.  I am not sure if I did it correctly.  I hope someone can check my work.

{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " is 20\n## Step 1: Calculate the price increase after the first two months\nThe price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% of the original price every two months. The original price is $20. To find the price increase after the first two months, we need to calculate 20% of $20. 20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the price after the first two months\nTo find the price after the first two months, we need to add the price increase to the original price. The price after the first two months is $20 + $4 = $24.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the price increase after the next two months\nThe price increase is 20% of the new price, which is $24. To find the price increase, we need to calculate 20% of $24. 20% of $24 is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the price after the next two months\nTo find the price after the next two months, we need to add the price increase to the price after the first two months. The price after the next two months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.\n\n## Step 5: Continue this process for the remaining 32 months\nWe need to repeat steps 3 and 4 for the remaining 32 months. Since the price increase is 20% of the current price, we can use a formula to calculate the price after each two months. The formula is: price = price * (1 + 0.20) = price * 1.20.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the formula to calculate the price after 36 months\nWe can apply the formula to calculate the price after 36 months. Since we have 18 periods of two months each, we can raise 1.20 to the power of 18 to find the total price increase. The price after 36 months is $20 * (1.20)^18.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the price after 36 months\nUsing a calculator, we can calculate the price after 36 months. The price after 36 months is $20 * (1.20)^18 ≈ $20 * 7.039 = $140.78.\n\n## Step 8: Round the price to two decimal places\nWe can round the price to two decimal places.

{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " is 4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws used.  The answer is 8. \nThe answer is 8. \n\nExplanation: \nTo find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to first calculate how many screws he will use in total.  We know that each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, so we can multiply the number of legs by the number of screws per leg to get the total number of screws used per table.  This is 4 legs x 2 screws = 8 screws per table.  Since James is putting together 4 tables, we can multiply the number of screws used per table by the number of tables to get the total number of screws used.  This is 8 screws per table x 4 tables = 32 screws used.  To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has.  This is 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over.  Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over. \n\nNote: The problem statement is a bit confusing, as it says '4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws used', which is not a correct mathematical operation.  The correct operation is 4 tables x 4 legs x 2 screws = 32 screws per 4 tables, not 32 screws used.  However, the problem statement is still solvable, and the correct answer is 8 screws left over. \n\nThis problem is a good example of how to use multiplication to solve a real-world problem, and how to subtract to find the leftover amount.

The cumulative net profit after \\( n \\) years is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Cumulative net profit} = n \\times \\$7.5 - \\$90 \\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the cumulative net profit is non-negative:\n\\[ n \\times \\$7.5 - \\$90 \\geq 0 \\]\n\\[ n \\times \\$7.5 \\geq \\$90 \\]\n\\[ n \\geq \\frac{90}{7.5} \\]\n\\[ n \\geq 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree. \n\nThe answer is 12. \\(\\boxed{12}\\) years. \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\) \\(\\", "idx": 197, "selected_model": 3}
