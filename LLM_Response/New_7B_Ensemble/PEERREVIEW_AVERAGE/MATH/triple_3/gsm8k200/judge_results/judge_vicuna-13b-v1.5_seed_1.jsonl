So, if we let \\(G\\) represent Gerald's original time, then \\(G + 2 = \\text{Lee's original time}\\).\n\n3. **Gerald's Improved Speed**: After changing his diet, Gerald's speed improved by 10%. This means his new time for the 400-meter hurdles is 90% of his original time (since improving by 10% means he's now running 10% faster than before). Mathematically, this can be represented as \\(0.9G\\).\n\n4. **Finding Gerald's Improved Time**: Since we know Lee's time after the improvement is 38 seconds, and this represents Lee's original time (because Gerald's improvement made him two seconds slower than Lee's original time), we can set up the equation based on the information that Lee's original time was \\(G + 2\\). Therefore, \\(G + 2 = 38\\), which means \\(G = 36\\) seconds was Gerald's original time.\n\n5. **Calculating Gerald's Improved Time**: Now, using the improved speed factor, we calculate Gerald's new time as \\(0.9G\\).

So, $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total taxes paid on Job A.\nThe state tax rate is 20%, so we calculate 20% of the total income from Job A. 20% of $30,000 is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the net income from Job A after taxes.\nTo find the net income from Job A, we subtract the total taxes paid from the total income before taxes.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.\n3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.\n4. Since the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books each, they can hold a total of 10 + 10 = 20 books.\n5. Now, let's see if these shelves can hold all the books. The bottom and top shelves together can hold 20 + 15 = 35 books. The middle 2 shelves can hold 20 books. So, they can hold a total of 20 + 20 = 40 books.\n6. However, Elly has 110 books, which is more than the 40 that the shelves can hold. This means she needs at least one more bookcase.\n7.

Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.\n\nWe can express these conditions with the following equations:\n\\[ S + H = 100 \\]\n\\[ H = S + 60 \\]\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \\( H \\):\n\\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \\]\n\\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( S \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n\\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 40 \\]\n\\[ S = \\frac{40}{2} \\]\n\\[ S = 20 \\]\n\nSo, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much Harry gets, we use the second equation:\n\\[ H = S + 60 \\]\n\\[ H = 20 + 60 \\]\n\\[ H = 80 \\]\n\nWe can verify our solution by checking that the total length of the fence is indeed 100 feet:\n\\[ S + H = 20 + 80 = 100 \\]\n\nThe amount of fence left over for Sam is simply the length of the fence that Sam gets, which is 20 feet.
