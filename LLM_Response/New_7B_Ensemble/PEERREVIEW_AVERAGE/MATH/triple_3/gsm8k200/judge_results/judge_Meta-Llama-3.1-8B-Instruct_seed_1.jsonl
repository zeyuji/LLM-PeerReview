There are 5 members eating rice for both lunch and dinner.\n\nSo, total daily consumption = (number of people) * (consumption per person per meal) * (meals per day)\n= 5 * 0.2 kg * 2\n= 2 kg\n\nThis means they consume 2 kg of rice daily.\n\nNow, we need to find out how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:\n\nDuration = Total amount of rice / Daily consumption\n= 42 kg / 2 kg/day\n= 21 days\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we convert days into weeks:\n\nDuration in weeks = Duration in days / 7\n= 21 days / 7\n= 3 weeks\n\nTherefore, the answer is the bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.<|im_end|>", "idx": 195, "selected_model": 2}

{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " First, let's calculate how much Carlos earns from selling lemons each year:\n\nHe gets 7 lemons per year, and each lemon sells for $1.5. So, his earnings from selling lemons each year are:\n\\[7 \\text{ lemons/year} \\times \\$1.5/\\text{lemon} = \\$10.5/\\text{year}\\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree each year from his earnings to find out how much he makes net profit each year:\n\\[\\$10.5/\\text{year} - \\$3/\\text{year} = \\$7.5/\\text{year}\\]\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) at this net profit rate of $7.5 per year.\n\nTo do this, divide the initial cost by the annual net profit:\n\\[\\frac{\\$90}{\\$7.5/\\text{year}} = 12 \\text{ years}\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree. \n\nThe answer is {12}.<|im_end|>", "idx": 197, "selected_model": 2}
