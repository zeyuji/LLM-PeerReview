{"task_name": "gsm8k200", "generation": " To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each member consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate daily consumption:**\n   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.\n   - There are 5 people in the household.\n   - They eat rice at both lunch and dinner, so there are 2 meals per day.\n\n   Therefore, the total daily consumption is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ people} \\times 0.2 \\text{ kg/person/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 2 \\text{ kg/day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the duration the 42 kg bag will last:**\n   - We have a 42 kg bag of rice.\n   - The household consumes 2 kg of rice per day.\n\n   To find out how many days the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{42 \\text{ kg}}{2 \\text{ kg/day}} = 21 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert days into weeks:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\text{ days}}{7 \\text{ days/week}} = 3 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.
