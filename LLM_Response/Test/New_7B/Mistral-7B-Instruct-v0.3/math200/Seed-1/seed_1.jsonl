Since the cards are restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A$, we can see that the parity (odd or even) of the positions of the cards from each pile must be the same for the stack to be magical.\n\nLet's denote the number of cards in pile $A$ as $a$ and the number of cards in pile $B$ as $b$. Since the total number of cards is $2n$, we have $a + b = n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the parity of the positions of the cards in each pile. Since the cards in pile $A$ are the top $n$ cards from the original stack, their positions are odd. On the other hand, the cards in pile $B$ are the remaining cards from the original stack, and their positions are even. Therefore, for the stack to be magical, the number of odd positions in pile $A$ must be equal to the number of even positions in pile $B$.\n\nSince the positions of the cards in pile $A$ are odd, the number of odd positions in pile $A$ is $a-1$ (because the top card in pile $A$ doesn't have a position in the original stack).

Since the number of cards in pile $B$ is $n-a$, we have $b = n-a$. Since the number of even positions in pile $B$ is $b-1$, we have $b-1$ is even, which means $b$ is odd. Therefore, the number of cards in pile $B$ is $b = 1, 3, 5, \\ldots, n-1$.\n\nSince the number of cards in pile $A$ and pile $B$ must be greater than or equal to 1, we have $1 \\leq a \\leq n-1$ and $1 \\leq b \\leq n-1$.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of pairs $(a, b)$ that satisfy the conditions for a magical stack.

The next step is to subtract $1/2$ from $n$. Since $n$ is an integer, subtracting $1/2$ will not change the integer part of $n$. However, it will change the fractional part. If the fractional part of $n$ was greater than or equal to $1/2$, then subtracting $1/2$ will make it less than $1/2$, and the integer part will decrease by $1$. If the fractional part of $n$ was less than $1/2$, then subtracting $1/2$ will make it less than $1/2$, but the integer part will remain the same. Let's call the result of this operation $m$.
