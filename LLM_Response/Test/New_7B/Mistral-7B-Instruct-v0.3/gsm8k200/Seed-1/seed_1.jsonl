The total straw pieces used for small rodents are 160, so we can write an equation:\n   18 * (number of rats per cage) + 50 = 160\n\n3. To solve for the number of rats per cage, we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:\n   18 * (number of rats per cage) = 160 - 50\n   18 * (number of rats per cage) = 110\n\n4. Now, divide both sides by 18 to find the number of rats per cage:\n   (number of rats per cage) = 110 / 18\n\n5. Simplify the fraction:\n   (number of rats per cage) = 11 / 2\n\nSo, the answer is: the answer is 11/2. This means that there are 11 rats in each cage, but since we cannot have a fraction of a rat, we can interpret this as having 6 full cages of 11 rats each, with 1 rat left over.

{"task_name": "gsm8k", "generation": "\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Grandma walks 3 miles in total, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.\n2. On the beach, she walks for 40 minutes, so her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute (mpm).\n3. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is 0.05 mpm * 2 = 0.1 mpm.\n4. Since the sidewalk is 1 mile long, it takes her 1 mile / 0.1 mpm = 10 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.\n5. In total, it takes her 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.\n\nThe answer is: the answer is 50 minutes.</s>", "idx": 190}

{"task_name": "gsm8k", "generation": "\n\nHere's how to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, let's find out how much rice is consumed by the household in one meal. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice and there are 5 people, the total consumption for one meal is 5 * 0.2 = 1 kg.\n\n2. Since the household eats rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), the total daily consumption is 1 kg * 2 = 2 kg.\n\n3. To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total weight of the bag by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.\n\n4. To find out how many weeks this is, we divide the number of days by 7: 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.\n\nSo, the answer is: the answer is 3.</s>", "idx": 195}

Annual income: The tree produces 7 lemons each year, which can be sold for $1.5 each. So, the annual income is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.\n\n2. Annual expenses: The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.\n\nNow, let's compare the annual income and expenses:\n\nIf the annual income is greater than the annual expenses, then Carlos starts earning money. In this case, the annual income is $10.5, and the annual expenses are $3. So, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n$10.5 > $3\n\nSince $10.5 is indeed greater than $3, it means that Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree in the first year.\n\nThe answer is: the answer is 1.</s>", "idx": 197}
