The total straw pieces used for small rodents are 160, so we can write an equation:\n   18 * (number of rats per cage) + 50 = 160\n\n3. To solve for the number of rats per cage, we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:\n   18 * (number of rats per cage) = 160 - 50\n   18 * (number of rats per cage) = 110\n\n4. Now, divide both sides by 18 to find the number of rats per cage:\n   (number of rats per cage) = 110 / 18\n\n5. Simplify the fraction:\n   (number of rats per cage) = 11 / 2\n\nSo, the answer is: the answer is 11/2. This means that there are 11 rats in each cage, but since we cannot have a fraction of a rat, we can interpret this as having 6 full cages of 11 rats each, with 1 rat left over.

The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches more than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes, so we can write this as: Topher's shoe length = 9x + 10\n3. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equivalent to 96 inches (since 1 foot is 12 inches). So we can write the equation for Topher's shoe length as: 96 = 9x + 10\n4. To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation and then divide by 9: x = (96 - 10) / 9\n5. Simplifying the equation gives us: x = 10.67 inches (approximately)\n\nSo, the answer is: the length of one of Bobby's shoes is approximately 10.67 inches.</s>", "idx": 257}

The weight of the remaining cake is 4 pieces * 2.5 ounces/piece = 10 ounces.\n\nThe answer is the remaining cake weighs 10 ounces.</s>", "idx": 384}

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. So, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we can ignore his reading for today.\n3. To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we simply subtract the total pages Daniel read (yesterday) from the total pages Denise read (yesterday + today).\n\nSo, the answer is: the answer is 18 (Denise's pages today) - 13 (Daniel's pages yesterday) = 5 pages.</s>", "idx": 385}

Digging through clay: Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil. So, his digging speed through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. It will take him 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours to dig through the 8 feet of clay.\n\nNow, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time it takes Bill to dig the well: 6 hours (soil) + 4 hours (clay) = 10 hours.\n\nThe answer is: the answer is 10 hours.</s>", "idx": 386}

Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'c'.\n\n3. The total cost of 240 cups is 240 * c.\n\n4. The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000, so the total cost of a dozen plates is 2 * $6000 = 12 * $6000 = 12 * 6000c = 72000c.\n\n5. We know that the total cost of 20 dozens of cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, 240c - 72000c = -1200.\n\n6. Solving for 'c', we get 72240c = 1200, so c = 1200 / 72240 = 0.0166.\n\n7. Therefore, the cost of one cup is $0.0166.\n\nSo, the answer is the cost of one cup is $0.0166.</s>", "idx": 389}

Since the difference in drying time is the same for each painting, we can simply multiply the difference in drying time by the number of paintings.\n\nThe answer is the new varnish will take 5 minutes * 6 paintings = 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.\n\nThe answer is the answer is 30.</s>", "idx": 390}
