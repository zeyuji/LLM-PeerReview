The function \\( \\sin x \\) is periodic with period \\( 2\\pi \\), and it oscillates between -1 and 1.

We can start by isolating the \\(x^2\\) term:\n\n\\[ y + 3 = 4x^2 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4 to get the equation in the form \\( x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(y + 3) \\):\n\n\\[ x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(y + 3) \\]\n\nNow, we can see that this equation is in the form \\( x^2 = 4p(y - k) \\), where \\( 4p = \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( k = -3 \\). Solving for \\( p \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 4p = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies p = \\frac{1}{16} \\]\n\nThe vertex of the parabola is at \\((0, -3)\\). Since the parabola opens upwards (the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is positive), the focus is located at \\((h, k + p)\\). Substituting the values of \\(h\\), \\(k\\), and \\(p\\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Focus} = \\left(0, -3 + \\frac{1}{16}\\right) = \\left(0, -\\frac{48}{16} + \\frac{1}{16}\\right) = \\left(0, -\\frac{47}{16}\\right) \\]\n\nTherefore, the focus of the parabola is \\(\\left(0, -\\frac{47}{16}\\right)\\).

{"task_name": "math", "generation": " To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function for all possible values of \\( x \\).\n\n1. **Domain Analysis**:\n   - The function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is defined for all real numbers except \\( x = 0 \\) because division by zero is undefined.\n   - Therefore, the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( (-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty) \\).\n\n2. **Behavior as \\( x \\to 0 \\)**:\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches 0 from either the positive or negative side, \\( x^2 \\) approaches 0, and thus \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) becomes very large.\n   - Mathematically, \\( \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{x^2} = +\\infty \\) and \\( \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} \\frac{1}{x^2} = +\\infty \\).\n   - This means that \\( f(x) \\) can take on any value greater than 0 as \\( x \\) gets closer to 0.\n\n3. **Behavior as \\( |x| \\to \\infty \\)**:\n   - As \\( x \\) moves away from 0 towards positive or negative infinity, \\( x^2 \\) also increases without bound.\n   - Consequently, \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) approaches 0 but never actually reaches 0.\n   - Mathematically, \\( \\lim_{x \\to \\pm\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Range Determination**:\n   - From the above analysis, we see that \\( f(x) \\) can take on any positive value but will never be zero.\n   - Therefore, the range of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is all positive real numbers.\n\nThus, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\nThe answer is the range of the function is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).
