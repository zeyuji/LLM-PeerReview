The function \\( \\sin x \\) is periodic with period \\( 2\\pi \\), and it oscillates between -1 and 1.

We can start by isolating the \\(x^2\\) term:\n\n\\[ y + 3 = 4x^2 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4 to get the equation in the form \\( x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(y + 3) \\):\n\n\\[ x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(y + 3) \\]\n\nNow, we can see that this equation is in the form \\( x^2 = 4p(y - k) \\), where \\( 4p = \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( k = -3 \\). Solving for \\( p \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 4p = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies p = \\frac{1}{16} \\]\n\nThe vertex of the parabola is at \\((0, -3)\\). Since the parabola opens upwards (the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is positive), the focus is located at \\((h, k + p)\\). Substituting the values of \\(h\\), \\(k\\), and \\(p\\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Focus} = \\left(0, -3 + \\frac{1}{16}\\right) = \\left(0, -\\frac{48}{16} + \\frac{1}{16}\\right) = \\left(0, -\\frac{47}{16}\\right) \\]\n\nTherefore, the focus of the parabola is \\(\\left(0, -\\frac{47}{16}\\right)\\).

{"task_name": "math", "generation": " To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function for all possible values of \\( x \\).\n\n1. **Domain Analysis**:\n   - The function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is defined for all real numbers except \\( x = 0 \\) because division by zero is undefined.\n   - Therefore, the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( (-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty) \\).\n\n2. **Behavior as \\( x \\to 0 \\)**:\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches 0 from either the positive or negative side, \\( x^2 \\) approaches 0, and thus \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) becomes very large.\n   - Mathematically, \\( \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{x^2} = +\\infty \\) and \\( \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} \\frac{1}{x^2} = +\\infty \\).\n   - This means that \\( f(x) \\) can take on any value greater than 0 as \\( x \\) gets closer to 0.\n\n3. **Behavior as \\( |x| \\to \\infty \\)**:\n   - As \\( x \\) moves away from 0 towards positive or negative infinity, \\( x^2 \\) also increases without bound.\n   - Consequently, \\( \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) approaches 0 but never actually reaches 0.\n   - Mathematically, \\( \\lim_{x \\to \\pm\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2} = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Range Determination**:\n   - From the above analysis, we see that \\( f(x) \\) can take on any positive value but will never be zero.\n   - Therefore, the range of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is all positive real numbers.\n\nThus, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).\n\nThe answer is the range of the function is \\( (0, \\infty) \\).

Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the fraction in decimal:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{16} = 0.1875\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the fraction to binary:**\n   - Start by multiplying the fractional part by 2 and recording the integer part.\n   - Continue this process until the fractional part becomes zero or you reach the desired precision.\n\n   Let's perform the multiplication step-by-step:\n   \n   \\[\n   0.1875 \\times 2 = 0.375 \\quad \\text{(integer part is 0)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0.375 \\times 2 = 0.75 \\quad \\text{(integer part is 0)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0.75 \\times 2 = 1.5 \\quad \\text{(integer part is 1)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\times 2 = 1.0 \\quad \\text{(integer part is 1)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the integer parts:**\n   The integer parts from each step give us the binary digits after the radix point. Reading them in order, we get:\n   \\[\n   0.1875_{10} = 0.0011_2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the result:**\n   To ensure our conversion is correct, let's convert \\(0.0011_2\\) back to decimal:\n   \\[\n   0.0011_2 = 0 \\times 2^{-1} + 0 \\times 2^{-2} + 1 \\times 2^{-3} + 1 \\times 2^{-4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0 + 0 + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{2}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{3}{16}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the binary representation of \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\) is indeed \\(0.0011_2\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0011}\n\\]<|endoftext|>", "idx": 345}

The key observation here is that the hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids by drawing the diameter through the vertices \\(A\\) and \\(D\\). This means that the sides \\(AB\\) and \\(DE\\) are opposite each other, and so are \\(BC\\) and \\(EF\\), and \\(CD\\) and \\(FA\\).\n\nGiven that five sides are equal and one side is different, the hexagon must be symmetric about the diameter passing through \\(A\\) and \\(D\\). Therefore, the diagonals \\(AC\\), \\(AD\\), and \\(AF\\) will all be equal in length because they are all diameters of the circle.\n\nTo find the length of these diagonals, we can use Ptolemy's theorem in the cyclic quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\). Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\), the product of the lengths of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides:\n\\[ AC \\cdot BD = AB \\cdot CD + AD \\cdot BC. \\]\n\nHowever, since \\(AB = 31\\) and the other four sides are 81, and knowing that \\(AC = AD = AF\\) (as they are all diameters), we can simplify our approach by recognizing that the length of the diagonal is simply the diameter of the circle.

By symmetry and the properties of the circle, the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle.\n\nUsing the fact that the hexagon can be split into two congruent trapezoids, and the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, we can conclude that the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle. The length of the diagonal is therefore the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle.\n\nThus, the length of each diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle. The length of the diagonal is therefore:\n\\[ AC = AD = AF = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{area of the hexagon}}{\\text{sum of the lengths of the sides}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{area of the hexagon}}{5 \\times 81 + 31} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{area of the hexagon}}{442}. \\]\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to recognize that the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the side opposite the shorter side, which is the diameter of the circle. The length of the diagonal is therefore:\n\\[ AC = AD = AF = \\sqrt{81^2 + 31^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 961} = \\sqrt{7522} = 81 + 31 = 112. \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the lengths of the three diagonals from \\(A\\) is:\n\\[ AC + AD + AF = 112 + 112 + 112 = 336. \\]\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{336}\\).<|endoftext|>", "idx": 398}
{"task_name": "math", "generation": " To determine how many different license plates can be formed with the given criteria, we need to consider the choices available for each part of the license plate.\n\n1. **Choosing the Letters:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.\n   - We need to choose 2 different letters from these 26.\n   - The first letter can be any of the 26 letters.\n   - After choosing the first letter, there are 25 remaining choices for the second letter.\n   - Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 different letters is \\(26 \\times 25\\).\n\n2. **Choosing the Digits:**\n   - There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9).\n   - We need to choose 2 different digits from these 10.\n   - The first digit can be any of the 10 digits.\n   - After choosing the first digit, there are 9 remaining choices for the second digit.\n   - Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 different digits is \\(10 \\times 9\\).\n\n3. **Combining the Choices:**\n   - Each choice of letters can be paired with each choice of digits.\n   - Therefore, the total number of different license plates is the product of the number of ways to choose the letters and the number of ways to choose the digits.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n\\[\n26 \\times 25 \\times 10 \\times 9\n\\]\n\nFirst, multiply the number of ways to choose the letters:\n\n\\[\n26 \\times 25 = 650\n\\]\n\nNext, multiply the result by the number of ways to choose the digits:\n\n\\[\n650 \\times 10 = 6500\n\\]\n\nFinally, multiply by the number of ways to choose the second digit:\n\n\\[\n6500 \\times 9 = 58500\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of different license plates that can be formed is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]<|endoftext|>", "idx": 399}
