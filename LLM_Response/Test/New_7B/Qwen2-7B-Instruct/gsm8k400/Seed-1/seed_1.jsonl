So for 24 feet of soil:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time through soil} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{24 \\text{ feet}}{4 \\text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes him to dig through the clay. He digs half as fast through clay, which means he digs at a rate of \\(4 \\text{ feet/hour} / 2 = 2 \\text{ feet/hour}\\). For 8 feet of clay:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time through clay} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{8 \\text{ feet}}{2 \\text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the time spent digging through soil and clay to find the total time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = \\text{Time through soil} + \\text{Time through clay} = 6 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 10 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the answer is the well will take Bill 10 hours to dig.<|im_end|>", "idx": 386}

{"task_name": "gsm8k", "generation": " Let's denote the cost of one cup as \\(C\\) and the cost of one plate as \\(P\\). \n\nFrom the problem statement, we have two equations:\n\n1) The total cost of 24 (which is twenty dozen) cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. This can be written as:\n\\[24C = \\frac{1}{2}P - 1200\\]\n\n2) Each plate costs $6000. So, \\(P = 6000\\).\n\nSubstituting the value of \\(P\\) into equation 1 gives us:\n\\[24C = \\frac{1}{2}(6000) - 1200\\]\n\\[24C = 3000 - 1200\\]\n\\[24C = 1800\\]\n\nTo find the cost of one cup (\\(C\\)), divide both sides by 24:\n\\[C = \\frac{1800}{24}\\]\n\\[C = 75\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $75. \n\nThe answer is {answer is 75}.<|im_end|>", "idx": 389}
